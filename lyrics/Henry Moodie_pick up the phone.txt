11 Contributors​​pick up the phone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some nights I don't even sleep
Chest tight with anxiety
Stay up to see the moon leave the sky
Some days I'm not even me
Same old insecurities
They tell me there's something going wrong inside

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been there, down that road
When you need me, I'll be here to let you know

[Chorus]
It's gonna be okay
Everyone needs a bad day
Remember you told me
"You're not alone, just pick up the phone
And call me whenever you're feeling lonely"
Remember you told me
"You're not alone, just pick up the phone"

[Verse 2]
Breakdown 'cause you're breaking through
No sky is forever blue
Things bloom whenever they've seen the rain
Your thoughts lie but I know the truth
The best days are ahead of you
Tomorrow isn't your yesterday
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been there, down that road
When you need me, I'll be here to let you know

[Chorus]
It's gonna be okay
Everyone needs a bad day
Remember you told me
"You're not alone, just pick up the phone
And call me whenever you're feeling lonely"
Remember you told me
"You're not alone, just pick up the phone"

[Bridge]
You're not alone, you're not alone
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
You're not alone, you're not alone
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
You're not alone, you're not alone
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
You're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone

[Chorus]
It's gonna be okay
Everyone needs a bad day
Remember you told me
"You're not alone, just pick up the phone"Embed
