7 ContributorsChristmas Lights Lyrics[Verse 1]
Season after season
We never found a rhyme
For all your reasons
Bleeding, you don't see it
My heart against my head
Internal treason

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You kissed me one night
You never thought twice
Now I’m a punchline
At least that means I'm something to you

[Chorus]
I'm so sick and tired
Of following the light of
Stars that already died
Am I just chasing anything that shines?
Baby, you’re so unaware
It's not your fault that you don't care
Like leaving up my Christmas lights in June
It's embarrassing how long I'll wait for you

[Verse 2]
You go, knowing I'll follow
The little bit of hope you leave me
For tomorrow
It's a sharp pill
It's hard to swallow
But if it helps take off thе edge
And fill the hollow
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Holе inside my chest
That’s shaped like you
No one fits the mould
So what’s the use?

[Chorus]
I'm so sick and tired
Of following the light of
Stars that already died
Am I just chasing anything that shines?
Baby, you’re so unaware
And it's not your fault that you don't care
It's like leaving up my Christmas lights in June
It’s embarrassing how long I'll wait for you

[Break]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm so sick and tired
Of following the light of
Stars that already died
Am I just chasing anything that shines?
Baby, you're so unaware
And it's not your fault that you don't care
It's like leaving up my Christmas lights in June
Oh, It's embarrassing how long I'll wait for you
[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's embarrassing how long I'll wait for youEmbed
