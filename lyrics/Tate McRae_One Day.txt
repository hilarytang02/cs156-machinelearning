She stares at her ceiling once again with a hundred thoughts
"Maybe he knows who I am, probably not"
She walks down the hall with her head down low, scared to meet his eyes
Even when she hears his voice, she's swarmed with butterflies

[Chorus]
It's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about a hundred thoughts and you are ninety-nine
I've understood that you will never be mine
And that's fine, I'm just breaking inside

[Verse 2]
He always walks the crowded halls and is blinded by this light
A girl who keeps her head down low and never shows her eyes
He's tried to talk to her, but there's no easy way
'Cause every time he raises his voice, she runs away

[Chorus]
Oh, it's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about a hundred thoughts and you are ninety-nine
I've understood that you will never be mine
And that's fine, I'm just breaking inside

[Bridge]
One day, maybe she'll stay
And start to head over his way
And one day, she'll look into his eyes
And instead of breaking, she'll call him mine
One day, he'll grab her by the waist
And force them to meet face to face
One day, he'll look into her eyes
And say that, "You're my only light"
