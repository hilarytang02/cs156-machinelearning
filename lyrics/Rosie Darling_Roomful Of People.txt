2 ContributorsRoomful of People Lyrics[Verse 1: Rosie Darling]
I'd cross the street if I saw you
Don't think I'm ready
'Cause we both know, I'd spill my guts
Out if you'll let me

[Pre-Chorus: Rosie Darling]
Ooh, it ended like it was never meant to be
So I moved on, I'd say most days I'm really happy, but

[Chorus: Rosie Darling]
In a roomful of people, I'd still choose you
I'd choose somethin' that's over, over someone new
I could say that I'm tryin', but it's not true
The thought of lettin' you go is worse than losin' you
I could love someone different, who loves me too
But it's no use
In a roomful of people, I'd still choose you
In a roomful of people, I'd still choose you

[Verse 2: Jake Scott, Rosie Darling & Jake Scott]
What if I fall for someone else
But you're still my person?
What if you wake up one day
And realize that we were perfect?

Ooh, you let it die, to me it was evergreen
So I moved on, pretend you're gone, but it's not working
What makes it worse is

[Chorus: Rosie Darling & Jake Scott]
In a roomful of people, I'd still choose you
I'd choose somethin' that's over, over someone new
I could say that I'm tryin', but it's not true
The thought of lettin' you go is worse than losin' you
I could love someone different, who loves me too
But it's no use
In a roomful of people, I'd still choose you
In a roomful of people, I'd still choose you

[Post-Chorus: Rosie Darling & Jake Scott]
I'd still choose you, you
I'd still choose you, would you choose me too?

[Bridge: Rosie Darling, Rosie Darling & Jake Scott]
I'd cross the street if I saw you
Unless you stopped me
No, it's not fair, I don't have you
But you still got me

[Chorus: Rosie Darling & Jake Scott]
In a roomful of people, I'd still choose you
I'd choose somethin' that's over, over someone new
I could say that I'm tryin', but it's not true
The thought of lettin' you go is worse than losin' you
I could love someone different, who loves me too
But it's no use
In a roomful of people, I'd still choose you
In a roomful of people, I'd still choose you
In a roomful of people, I'd still choose youEmbed
