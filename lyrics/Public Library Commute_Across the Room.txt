12 ContributorsAcross the Room Lyrics[Intro]
Do do do do
Woah

[Verse 1: Public Library Commute]
Walk into to the place
I spot you from a ways
My heart, it started racing
A crowd across the way
The flowers on your face
And denim from the eighties

[Chorus: Public Library Commute, Forrest. & Public Library Commute]
Someone keeps blocking my wave
I can't feel farther away
Wait on a moment to say that I want you
You know that I want you, oh
Oh-oh-oh
(Mmh-mmh-mmh)
Across the room
(Mmh-mmh-mmh)
Across the room

[Verse 2: Forrest.]
Lost and in a daze
I caught your sudden gaze
And time, it started racing
But moments tend to fade
And you're too far away
For me to get my name in
You might also like[Chorus: Forrest., Forrest. & Public Library Commute]
Someone keeps blocking my wave
I can't feel further away, oh
Wait on a moment to say that I want you
You know that want you, mmh-mmh-mmh
(Mmh-mmh-mmh)
Across the room
(Mmh-mmh-mmh)
Across the room

[Verse 3: Public Library Commute & Forrest.]
And if you could read my mind (Ooh)
Will you make your way towards mine?
And if you could read my mind
Will you cross this room tonight?
