10 Contributors​golden thing Lyrics[Intro]
No, ooh, woah

[Verse 1]
Crystal dream
Cali queen
Radiant hand
Vibrant sand

[Chorus]
I'm shot
It's a golden thing she's got

[Verse 2]
A thousand thrills
A thousand chills
Smoky eye
Pearly white

[Chorus]
I'm hot
It's a golden thing she's got

[Post-Chorus]
I sing softly to her
In the last daylight
And the chorus of birds
In the heights of night
And if we could be heard
For whatever it's worth
The rulers in the sky
They'd cry

Diamond throne
All on her own
Coffee skin
She let me in

[Chorus]
I'm shot
It's a golden thing she's got
It's a golden thing

[Post-Chorus]
And I shouted the words
In the first daylight
And the chorus of birds
Burst on into sight
Now I know that I'm heard
For whatever it's worth
By the rulers in the sky

[Verse 4]
Deep blue jeans
Movie screens
Taking flight
Flashing lights
[Chorus]
I'm shot
It's a golden thing we've gotEmbed
