Hey, mom, I know we're gettin' old
And the lines on our hands have changed
But you still look at me the same
Hey, mom, guess what? You're really tough
And I know you did all you could
Just to make sure my life was good

[Pre-Chorus]
Sorry for the fights and the tone of my voice
Sorry for the nights when I made the wrong choice
Life is flyin' by and it's hittin' me now
I hope it's not, but

[Chorus]
If this is the last time, please come close
I love you with all my heart, you know
I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye
If this is the last time
Then let's do the things we always do
Like go to the mall and buy some shoes
I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye
If this is the last time

[Verse 2]
Hey, dad, what's up? Miss you so much
Yeah, the shade of your hair has changed
But I look up to you the same

Taught me how to fish, taught me how to ride a bike
Taught me how to love, how to treat a woman right
Life is flyin' by and it's hittin' me now
I hope it's not, but

[Chorus]
If this is the last time, please come close
I love you with all my heart, you know
I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye
If this is the last time
Then let's do the things we always do
Like go for a drive or watch the news
I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye
If this is the last time

[Bridge]
Hey you, sit back
Don't go so fast

[Chorus]
If this is the last time, please come close
I love you with all my heart, you know
I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye
If this is the last time
So let's do the things we always do
Or maybe we try something brand new
I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye
If this is the last time
[Outro]
If this is the last time
If this is the last time
Oh, if this is the last time
If this is the last time
If this is the last time
Oh, if this is the last time3Embed
