I'm anxious, kinda sad
Hard to be your best when you lost the best you had
Spendin' days just on my phone
Wonderin' where it all went wrong
I'm nervous, pretty wired
I said your name too much, now my lungs got tired
Thinkin' maybe I'm to blame
I just need someone to hate

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
You made this so damn hard for me
You and your goddamn honesty
It got me thinkin'

[Chorus]
I wish you woulda cheated
And smashed my heart to pieces
I wish I had a reason I could hate your guts for leavin'
I wish you were the villain
A psycho with no feelings
So how do I move on
When you did nothin' wrong?

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Wish you did somethin' wrong
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
But you did nothin' wrong
You might also like[Verse 2]
Know it's messed up, kinda bad (Oh)
But I wish we didn't talk and you just left like that
I'd be angry instead of numb
Damn it, who have I become?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
You made this so damn hard for me
You and your goddamn honesty
It got me thinking

[Chorus]
I wish you woulda cheated
And smashed my heart to pieces
I wish I had a reason I could hate your guts for leavin'
I wish you were the villain
A psycho with no feelings
So how do I move on
When you did nothin' wrong?

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Wish you did somethin' wrong
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
But you did nothin' wrong
[Bridge]
In the middle of the night
I start to fantasize that you would ruin my whole life
Oh-oh-oh, 'cause you're the best I had
And I keep runnin' back like a goddamn fool tryna change your mind
You were all mine
Can't believe I

[Chorus]
Wish you woulda cheated
And smashed my heart to pieces
I wish I had a reason I could hate your guts for leavin'
I wish you were the villain (Oh, woah)
A psycho with no feelings (Oh)
So how do I move on (Oh)
When you did nothin' wrong?Embed
