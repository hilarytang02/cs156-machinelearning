3 ContributorsLocket Lyrics[Verse 1]
You put my love in a locket, lost it, even through you promised
Thick and thin we'd fight this, never end up like this
Light grip, tight fist, the irony is priceless
Need me in a crisis, leave me like a sidechick, bye then
The end, I'll never be your side man
Never be your right-hand man (Mm-mm-mm), lyin'
Lyin', done with all your lyin'
I'm cuttin' off your line and I'm leavin'

[Chorus]
'Cause it ain't worth it to be
Someone who's just convenient for you to need (Mm-mm-mm)
And it's so hurtful to think
All this time you were just prеtending to be into me

[Verse 2]
Pic of us in your wallеt, cocked it, found out where you dropped it
Guess you went and cropped it, took that thing and chopped it
Squashed it, moshed it, now it's in a cockpit
Shredded up like garbage, can't believe my love was in your locket
Locked it, had me in your pocket
Had to go and park it (Mm)

[Chorus]
'Cause it ain't worth it to be
Someone who's just convenient for you to need (Mm-mm-mm)
And it's so hurtful to think
All this time you were just pretending to be into me
You might also like[Bridge]
It's never worth it to be somebody who's just tolerated
Ain't nothin' real with tryna fake it
Wanna be with somebody where I'll be celebrated
You put my love in a locket, lost it, even through you promised
Thick and thin we'd fight this, never end up like this

[Chorus]
'Cause it ain't worth it to be
Someone who's just convenient for you to need (Mm-mm-mm)
And it's so hurtful to think
All this time you were just pretending to be into meEmbed
