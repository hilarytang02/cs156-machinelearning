Honey, come over
The party's gone slower
And no one will tempt you
We know you got sober
There's orange juice in the kitchen
Bought for the children
It's yours if you want it
We're just glad you could visit

[Chorus]
Feels like I've been ready for you to come home
For so long
That I didn't think to ask you where you'd gone
Why'd you go?

[Post-Chorus]
And you said
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm-mm"
And you said
You said my heart has changed and my soul has changed
And my heart, and my heart
Now my face has changed, and I haven't drank
In six months on the dot

[Verse 2]
See the graves as you pass through
From our crash back in '02
Not one nick on your finger
You just asked mе to hold you
But it made you a stranger
And filled you with angеr
Now I'm third in the line up
To your Lord and your Savior

Feels like I've been ready for you to come home
For so long
That I didn't think to ask you where you'd gone
So why'd you go?

[Post-Chorus]
And you said
"Mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, mm"
You said
"Mm-hmm"
You said my heart has changed and my soul has changed
And my heart, and my heart
That my life has changed, that this town had changed and you had not
That the world has changed, don't you find it strange
That you just went ahead and carried on?
And you know I'd say, the last time I drank
I was face down, passed out there in your lawn
Are we all just crows to you now?
Are we all just pullin' you down?
You didn't put those bones in the ground
You didn't put those bones in the ground

[Outro]
Honey, come over
The party's gone slower
And no one will tempt you
We know you got sober
There's orange juice in the kitchen
Bought for the children
It's yours if you want it
We're just glad you could visitEmbed
