Mm

[Verse 1]
How long will I love you?
As long as stars are above you
And longer if I can

[Verse 2]
How long will I need you?
As long as the seasons need to
Follow their plan

[Verse 3]
How long will I be with you?
As long as the sea is bound to
Wash up on the sand

[Verse 4]
How long will I want you?
As long as you want me to
And longer by far

[Verse 5]
How long will I hold you?
As long as your father told you
As long as you can
You might also like[Verse 6]
How long will I give to you?
As long as I live through you
However long you say

[Verse 7]
How long will I love you?
As long as stars are above you
And longer if I may

[Bridge]
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm
