You gotta help me
I'm losing my mind
Keep getting the feelin'
You wanna leave this all behind

[Refrain: Harry]
Thought we were going strong
I thought we were holdin' on
Aren't we?

[Verse 2: Niall]
No, they don't teach ya
This in school
Now my heart's breakin'
And I don't know what to do

[Refrain: Niall]
Thought we were going strong
I thought we were holdin' on
Aren't we?

[Chorus: All, Liam]
You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)
We could be the greatest team
That the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more
We can live forever

All of the rumours
All of the fights
But we always find a way
To make it out alive

Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holdin' on
Aren't we?

You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)
We could be the greatest team

You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more
We can live forever

[Bridge: Louis]
Minibars, expensive cars
Hotel rooms and new tattoos
The good champagne and private planes
But they don't mean anything
'Cause the truth is out, I realise
That without you here, life is just a lie
This is not the end, this is not the end
We can make it, you know it, you know
[Chorus: All, Liam]
You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)
We could be the greatest team
That the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more
We can live forever
You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)
We could be the greatest team
That the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more
We can live forever
[Outro: Harry, All, Liam]
So don't let me go, so don't let me go
We can live forever
Baby, don't you know? Baby, don't you know?
We can live forever55Embed
