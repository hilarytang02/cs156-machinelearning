I spent years just tryna build you up
Who knew that your stones were made of dust?
If I only knew
You'd turn my yellow to blue
And maybe someday soon, the clouds will break
You'll see that we don't have to be this way
If you only knew
The damage you do

[Pre-Chorus]
But I let you tear me apart

[Chorus]
So keep on doing what you do
Pouring salt into the wounds
And I'll keep on trying
To tell myself that it's okay
I never learn from my mistakes
'Cause I keep on trying
To find your silver lining

[Verse 2]
I loved you when you couldn't love yourself
There's only so much I can do to help
In getting you through
Whenever you're blue
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So go on and tear me apart

[Chorus]
And keep doing what you do
Pouring salt into the wounds
And I'll keep on trying
To tell myself that it's okay
I never learn from my mistakes
'Cause I keep on trying
To find your silver lining

[Chorus]
'Cause I keep on trying
To tell myself that it's okay
I never learn from my mistakes
'Cause I keep on trying
To find your silver lining
To find your silver liningEmbed
