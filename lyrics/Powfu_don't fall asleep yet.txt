Don't fall asleep yet, I'm wide awake still
I wonder if you think about me when you lay still
Don't fall asleep yet, promise you'll stay here
Are my pictures on your wall still like last year?

[Chorus]
Don't fall asleep yet, I'm wide awake still
I wonder if you think about me when you lay still
It's been a long time, miss you around me
When I dream about you, are you dreamin' 'bout me?

[Bridge]
Don't fall asleep, I'm wide awake
I hope that we have brighter days
You still have my heart, so don't let it break

[Verse 1]
I want you all mine forever
I'll put my heart on a projector
I wish we settled all the struggles we got into
The best part of my life was with you

[Chorus]
Don't fall asleep yet, I'm wide awake still
I wonder if you think about me when you lay still
It's been a long time, miss you around me
When I dream about you, are you dreamin' 'bout me?

Ayy, think about you too much
Tryna fall asleep but my eyes won't shut
Said you need a break and that's okay
But when you feel alone, always got my place
Life throws curves, sorry for your loss
Praying for your peace when the nights feel long, yeah
Writin' songs for you with my guitar
Leave if you want, but please don't go far, ayy

[Outro]
Don't fall asleep, I'm wide awake
Don't fall asleep, I'm wide awake
I hope that we have brighter days
You still have my heart, so don't let it break5Embed
