7 ContributorsDinosaurs in Love Lyrics[Fenn Rosenthal & Tom Rosenthal]
Dinosaurs eating people
Dinosaurs in love
Dinosaurs having a party, they eat fruit and cucumber

They, they fell in love
Then what'd they do?
They say thank you
A Big Bang came, and they, and they died

Dinosaurs, dinosaurs fell in love
But they didn't say goodbye
But they didn't say goodbyeYou might also likeEmbed
