86 ContributorsOver Again Lyrics[Verse 1: Liam, Niall, Both]
Said I'd never leave her, 'cause her hands fit like my T-shirt
Tongue tied over three words, cursed
Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt
Bodies intertwined with her lips
Now she's feeling so low since she went solo
Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo
And it's no joke to me
So can we do it all over again?

[Chorus: All]
If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

[Verse 2: Harry, Louis]
Can we take the same road? Two days in the same clothes?
And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute?
You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it
And tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart, we can both remove the masks
And admit we regret it from the start

If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

[Bridge: Zayn]
You'll never know how to make it on your own
And you'll never show weakness for letting go
I guess it's still hard if the seed's sown
But do you really want to be alone?

[Breakdown: Liam]
If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me

[Chorus: All, Zayn, Harry]
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart (All my heart)
