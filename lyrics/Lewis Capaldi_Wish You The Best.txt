I miss knowing what you're thinking
And hearing how your day has been
Do you think you could tell me everything, darling?
But leave out every part about him
Right now, you're probably by the ocean
While I'm still out here in the rain
With every day that passes by since we've spoken
It's like Glasgow gets farther from LA

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe it's supposed to be this way

[Chorus]
But, oh, my love
I wanna say, "I miss the green in your eyes"
And when I said we could be friends, guess I lied
I wanna say, "I wish that you never left"
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best
I wanna say, "Without you, everything's wrong"
And you were everything I need all along
I wanna say, "I wish that you never left"
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best

[Verse 2]
Well, I can't help but notice
You seem happier than ever now
And I guess that I should tell you I'm sorry
It seems I was the problem somehow
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I only brought you down

[Chorus]
But, oh, my love
I wanna say, "I miss the green in your eyes"
And when I said we could be friends, guess I lied
I wanna say, "I wish that you never left"
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best
I wanna say, "Without you, everything's wrong"
And you were everything I need all along
I wanna say, "I wish that you never left"
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best

[Bridge]
But, oh, my love
Oh, woah
Oh, my love
Oh, woah

[Chorus]
Wish I could say it's something I really mean
But I want you happy whether or not it's with me
I wanna say, "I wish that you never left"
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best
I wanna say, "Without you, everything's wrong"
And you were everything I need all along
I wanna say, "I wish that you never left"
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best3Embed
