One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Settle down with me
Cover me up, cuddle me in
Lie down with me, yeah
And hold me in your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
And your heart's against my chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm fallin' for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with a feelin', I'll forget, I'm in love now

[Chorus]
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like fallin' in love
We're fallin' in love
We're fallin' in love

[Verse 2]
Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as the wind blows
So hold me in your arms
Oh, no
