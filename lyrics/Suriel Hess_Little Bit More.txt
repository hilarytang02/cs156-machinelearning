I know sometimes I'm slow to tell you
It's no one else's fault but mine
If you don't know by the way I hold you
My heart's been yours this whole time

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I hope I show it
Just in case you need to know

[Chorus]
I fall in love with you a little bit more
Little bit, little bit, a little bit more
Every time I think I've lost my way
I fall in love with you a little bit more
Little bit, little bit more than before
Even on the days I'm not so sure
I fall in love with you a little bit more

[Verse 2]
I thought I knew every little thing about you
There's always more of you to learn
You try your best to show your worst
Baby, you can rest assured
I'll always be here for you
Always be here for you

Little bit, little bit, a little bit more
Every time I think I've lost my way
I fall in love with you a little bit more
Little bit, little bit more than before
Even on the days I'm not so sure
I fall in love with you a little bit more, more

[Bridge]
Can't explain it, and I don't know what to call it
All I know is I keep falling

[Chorus]
I fall in love with you a little bit more
Little bit, little bit, a little bit more
Every time I think I've lost my way
I fall in love with you a little bit more
Little bit, little bit more than before
Even on the days I'm not so sure
I fall in love with you a little bit more

I fall in love with you a little bit more
I fall in love with you a little bit moreEmbed
