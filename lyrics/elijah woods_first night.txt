5 Contributors​first night Lyrics[Intro: elijah woods]
Ah, ah

[Verse 1: elijah woods]
When I met you that day in June, know you were everything I dreamed about
Said that you can only stay 'til two and that your momma would be freaking out
Driving through streetlights, listening to b-sides thinking baby I don't want it to end (Oh-oh, oh, oh)
I never wanted anyone but you, but we can never get the timing down

[Pre-Chorus: elijah woods & JESSIA]
Every time that we get close
Oh, I can't stand the thought of letting go

[Chorus: elijah woods & JESSIA]
Remember way back when in August (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)
The summer night out at your cottage (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)
Always in the right place at the wrong time (Wrong time)
Things changе but it's alright (Alright)
The truth is I still get nostalgic, and I go back to the first night (First night)

[Verse 2: JESSIA]
Mеt someone about a month ago
He's kinda borin' but he treats me nice
Think you and him might wear the same cologne
I kinda like it but it don't feel right
Funny how, one night and a quick goodye
Got me callin' you at 3AM like
Come through when I'm home alone, I know we shouldn't but it crossed my mind
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: elijah woods & JESSIA]
Every single place I go
I see your face and wonder if you're close

[Chorus: elijah woods & JESSIA]
Remember way back when in August (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)
The summer night out at your cottage (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)
Always in the right place at the wrong time (Wrong time)
Things change but it's alright (Alright)
The truth is I still get nostalgic, and I go back to the first night (First night)
And I go back to the first night

[Bridge: elijah woods, JESSIA, elijah woods & JESSIA]
In another life I'd say it, you're the only one I want
In and out my life, I hate this, when's it gonna be just us?
Sick and tired of these daydreams (Oh, oh, oh)
I want love to have some meaning oh, oh
Are you thinking 'bout the same thing, do you go back?
'Cause I go back to the first night

[Chorus: elijah woods & JESSIA]
Remember way back when in August (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)
The summer night out at your cottage (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)
Always in the right place at the wrong time (Wrong time)
Things change but it's alright (Alright)
The truth is I still get nostalgic, and I go back to the first nightEmbed
