You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You're just like Heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I just thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

[Verse 2]
Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothin' else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
So if you feel how I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to bе true
I can't take my eyеs off of you

[Chorus]
I love you, baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, for the lonely nights
My pretty baby, just know that it's true
Oh, pretty baby, don't hold me down, I pray
I need you, baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, baby, let me love you
