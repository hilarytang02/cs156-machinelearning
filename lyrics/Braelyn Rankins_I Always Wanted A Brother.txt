When I am king
No other animal will break my stride, break my stride
And my brother

[YOUNG MUFASA]
My brother

[YOUNG TAKA]
When I'm king, you'll always take my side

[YOUNG MUFASA]
Ha! Yeah, right

[YOUNG TAKA]
That's right
When I am king

[YOUNG MUFASA]
When you are king

[YOUNG TAKA]
No other animal will break our pride, break our pride
And my brother

Our prey may run away, but they can't hide

[YOUNG MUFASA]
Watch your hide

[YOUNG TAKA]
Let's go
Let's go

[YOUNG MUFASA & YOUNG TAKA]
Let's go!

[ENSEMBLE]
Hey, did your Mama say
You could be up this late?

[YOUNG TAKA]
Okay, she didn't say
Either way

[YOUNG MUFASA & YOUNG TAKA]
Hide away, let's go

[ENSEMBLE]
Hey, did your Father say
You could be out this far?
[YOUNG TAKA]
Okay, we're on our way

[YOUNG MUFASA & YOUNG TAKA]
On our way
Run away, let's go

[ENSEMBLE]
Hеy, did your Mama say
You could be up this late?

[YOUNG TAKA & YOUNG MUFASA]
Ha-ha! You're vеry sharp
Yes, you are (Ooh, ah)
Yes, you are (Eeh, ah), let's go

[ENSEMBLE]
Hey, did your Father say
You could be out this far?

[YOUNG TAKA]
Make a wish on the brightest star, and I say

I always wanted a brother
I always wanted a brother
I always wanted a brother
Just like you
[YOUNG MUFASA & YOUNG TAKA]
And I always wanted a brother
I always wanted a brother
I always wanted a brother
Just like you

[YOUNG MUFASA, spoken]
You see that tree?

[YOUNG MUFASA]
Those birds are watching the world unfold

[YOUNG TAKA]
The world unfold?
Oh, brother

[YOUNG MUFASA]
My brother

[YOUNG TAKA]
When I'm king, they will do as they're told

[YOUNG MUFASA]
You may look down on them, but they are free

[YOUNG TAKA]
You can't catch me

[YOUNG MUFASA]
And where they go cannot be controlled

[YOUNG TAKA]
No one looks down on me

[YOUNG MUFASA]
They look down on us, brother

[YOUNG TAKA]
Ha!

[YOUNG MUFASA]
Some things you chase but you cannot hold

[YOUNG TAKA]
Okay, it's getting old
Let's go

[YOUNG MUFASA & YOUNG TAKA]
Let's go!

[ENSEMBLE]
Hey, did your Mama say
That you could learn this way?

[YOUNG MUFASA]
I've got to find a way
Find our prey

[YOUNG TAKA]
Fine, I'll wait

[YOUNG MUFASA & YOUNG TAKA]
Let's go!

[ENSEMBLE]
Hey

[CHIGARU]
I heard his father say
He doesn't want this stray

[ENSEMBLE]
Ooh!

[YOUNG TAKA]
I dare you to say that again to my face

What did you say 'bout my brother?
That's not a stray, that's my brother
You stay away from my brother
'Cause I say so

[YOUNG TAKA & ENSEMBLE]
If you put your paws on my brother
You'll meet the jaws of his brother

[YOUNG TAKA]
Those are the laws for my brother

[YOUNG TAKA, spoken]
Where'd he go?

[YOUNG MUFASA]
I always wanted a brother
I still remember my mother
One season after another

[ENSEMBLE & YOUNG MUFASA]
One season after another (Another, another)

[ENSEMBLE]
One season after another
One season after another

[TAKA & ENSEMBLE]
Everyone sing for my brother (Hey)
I'd do anything for my brother (Hey)
Soon, I'll be king with my brother (Hey)
By my side (Hey)

[MUFASA & ENSEMBLE]
I always wanted a brother (Hey)
