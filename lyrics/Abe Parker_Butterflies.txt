10 ContributorsButterflies Lyrics[Verse 1]
How do I tell you I need you?
When you steal the breath in my lungs?
My body shakes 'til the blood in my face
Makes me awkward smile and turn around
How do I hold these emotions?
When you spin my world out of place?
One look at me and it feels like everything
Is written marker on my face

[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm
I'm hopin' maybe you can tell me now

[Chorus]
Am I the only one that's catchin' butterflies?
Am I moth in your flame?
Do you burn the same when I
Look in your eyes
Do you get butterflies?
Butterflies

[Verse 2]
Don't know what I'd do without you
And that's why you're not here in my arms
I'm so scared to lose what we already have
Askin' for everything that I want
'Cause maybe I raised all your red flags
And these green lights are just in my head
I swear that there's something we both can't explain
And I'm terrified to lose it

I'm hopin' maybe you can tell me now

[Chorus]
Am I the only one that's catchin' butterflies?
Am I moth in your flame?
Do you burn the same when I
Hopin' maybe you can tell me now
Am I the only one that's catchin' butterflies?
Am I moth in your flame?
Do you burn the same when I
Look in your eyes
Look in my eyes
Do you get butterflies
