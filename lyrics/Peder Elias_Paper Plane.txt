4 ContributorsPaper Plane Lyrics[Chorus]
I'ma send a paper plane
I hope it flies your way
That it don't crash and break
Before it gets to you

[Verse 1]
Don't know how but feels like the dream (Am I delusional?)
Lost the ability to speak (It's so unusual)
Ever since the day in the park when we talked
I've kept on thinking about what we could be

[Pre-Chorus]
Dream about a late night, red sky
Your hand in mine, oh-oh
Don't know if you think about me
Think, think about

[Chorus]
I'ma send a paper plane
I hope it flies your way
That it don't crash and break
Before it gets to you
Right now I'm too shy to say
What I have felt for days
It's еasier this way
I hope it gets to you
You might also like[Verse 2]
Damn it feels likе I'm back in school (A million butterflies)
Why can't I just walk up to you? (It's like I'm paralyzed)
'Cause I've been staying up late every night
Thinking 'bout it
Is it just me or do you feel it, too?

[Pre-Chorus]
Dream about a late night, red sky
Your hand in mine, oh-oh
Don't know if you think about me
Think, think about

[Chorus]
I'ma send a paper plane
I hope it flies your way
That it don't crash and break
Before it gets to you
Right now, I'm too shy to say
What I have felt for days
It's easier this way

[Post-Chorus]
You got me stuck in a day dream
I don't wanna wake up
'Cause it feels amazing
And I can't get enough
Yeah, sometimes I wonder, am I stupid or not?
But I hope
I hope it gets to you
[Outro]
I'ma send a paper plane
I hope it flies your way
That it don't crash and break
Before it gets to youEmbed
[Chorus]
I'ma send a paper plane
I hope it flies your way
That it don't crash and break
Before it gets to you
