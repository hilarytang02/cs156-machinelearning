6 ContributorsThe God Who Stays Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I were You I would've given up on me by now
I would've labeled me a lost cause
'Cause I feel just like a lost cause
If I were You I would've turned around and walked away
I would've labeled me beyond repair
'Cause I feel like I'm beyond repair

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but somehow You don't see me like I do
Somehow You're still here

[Chorus]
You're the God who stays
You're the God who stays
You're the one who runs in my direction
When the whole world walks away
You're the God who stands
With wide open arms
And You tell me nothing I have ever done can separate my heart
From the God who stays

[Verse 2]
I used to hide
Every time I thought I let You down
I always thought I had to earn my way
But I'm learning You don't work that way
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause somehow You don't see me like I do
Somehow You're still here

[Chorus]
You're the God who stays (You're the God who stays)
You're the God who stays (You're the God who stays)
You're the one who runs in my direction
When the whole world walks away
You're the God who stands (You're the God who stands)
With wide open arms (With wide open arms)
And You tell me nothing I have ever done can separate my heart
From the God who stays

[Bridge]
My shame can't separate
My guilt can't separate
My past can't separate
I'm Yours forever
My sin can't separate
My scars can't separate
My failures can't separate
I'm Yours forever
No enemy can separate
No power of hell can take away
Your love for me will never change
I'm Yours forever
[Chorus]
You're the God who stays (You're the God who stays)
You're the God who stays (You're the God who stays)
You're the one who runs in my direction
When the whole world walks away
You're the God who stands (You're the God who stands)
With wide open arms (With wide open arms)
And You tell me nothing I have ever done can separate my heart
From the God who stays
You're the God who stays
You're the one who runs in my direction
When the whole world walks away
You're the God who stands
With wide open arms
And You tell me nothing I have ever done can separate my heart
From the God who stays1Embed
