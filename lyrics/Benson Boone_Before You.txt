15 ContributorsBefore You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Why would I want to fly
Be on the last red eye
Talkin' to your voice, only hearing noise
Oh, it's not enough
All of the nights I spent
Drownin' my discontent
Wasting me away, everything has changed
Now that I found us

[Pre-Chorus]
And it feels like home

[Chorus]
Darling, if you don't mind
I'll take your hand tonight
We could just slow down time
Let me adore you
And from the moment I looked in those dark brown eyes
I can't remember life
Before you

[Verse 2]
Why would I want to go?
Now that you're all I know
Smilin' under stars
Playin' chasin' cars
Somethin' 'bout the art of music in the dark

Darling, if you don't mind
I'll take your hand tonight
We could just slow down time
Lеt me adore you
And from the moment I looked in those dark brown eyes
I can't remember life
Before you
Oh, before you

[Bridge]
I bet I was lost and alone
I was barely holding on
To the thought of a moment like this
I bet I was lost and alone
I was barely holding on
To the thought of a moment like this
I must have been lost and alone
I was barely holding on
To the thought that someone like you exists

[Outro]
Darling, if you don't mind
I'll take your hand tonight
We could just slow down timeEmbed
