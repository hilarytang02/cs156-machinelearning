1 ContributorHold the applause LyricsMirror mirror on the wall
Who’s the dumbest of them all
Guess it must be me ‘cause I just hit rock bottom

Called you on a late night walk
For a little pillow talk
This is why I don’t let myself get too fond of

Falling for someone who clearly won’t care
I took it too far when we played truth or dare

Guess this is what happens when I trust someone
You gave me a spotlight, so I opened up
But the joke is on me, now I’m on my last straw
So let’s pull the curtain and hold the applause

Mirror mirror on the wall
I should have you uninstalled
‘Cause I don’t recognize who I’m looking at lately

Thought I had it down this time
But no one’s hitting up my line
Think I gave away too much til I went crazy

Falling for games I don’t know how to play
Too bad I caught feelings instead of my mistakes
You might also likeThis is what happens when I trust someone
You gave me a spotlight, so I opened up
But the joke is on me, now I’m on my last straw
So let’s pull the curtain and hold the applause

They say set an example
But don’t follow mine
‘Cause I’ve set myself up to fail every time

Find your reflection
And say, “listen up
I’m sorry if hearing this kills all the fun”

But this is what happens
If you trust someone
They’ll give you a spotlight
And you’ll open up
Then they’ll turn right around and expose all your flaws
So best pull the curtain
And hold the applause1Embed
