It was you when we first met eyes
It was you in the city lights
It was you when I almost lost control
It was you through the darkest times
It was you that would make me shine
It was you that I hold on tight
It's always been you

[Chorus]
So let the doors just open wide
'Cause standing there is my whole life
I've waited long enough to finally say "I do"
And let the people on both sides
See you there and all the rest
See us hand and hand
It where I always knew
It's always been you

[Verse 2]
Now it's you walking down that aisle
Now it's you I can't help but smile
Now it's you staring back at me
Forever to be
Now it's you I see my whole world
Now it's you never been more sure
Now it's you, it's always been you
You might also like[Chorus]
So let the doors just open wide
'Cause standing there is my whole life
I've waited long enough to finally say "I do"
And let the people on both sides
See you there and all the rest
See us hand and hand
It where I always knew
It's always been you
It's always been you

[Outro]
So let the doors just open wide
'Cause standing there is my whole life
I've waited long enough to finally say "I do"
It's always been you1Embed
