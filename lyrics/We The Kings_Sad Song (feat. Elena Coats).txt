You and I
We're like fireworks and symphonies exploding in the sky
With you, I'm alive
Like all the missing pieces of my heart, they finally collide

[Pre-Chorus: We The Kings]
So stop time right here in the moonlight
'Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes

[Chorus: We The Kings]
Without you, I feel broke
Like I'm half of a whole
Without you, I've got no hand to hold
Without you, I feel torn
Like a sail in a storm
Without you, I'm just a sad song
I'm just a sad song

[Verse 2: Elena Coats]
With you, I fall
It's like I'm leaving all my past in silhouettes up on the wall
With you, I'm a beautiful mess
It's like we're standing hand in hand with all our fears up on the edge

[Pre-Chorus: Elena Coats]
So stop time right here in the moonlight
'Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes

Without you, I feel broke
Like I'm half of a whole
Without you, I've got no hand to hold
Without you, I feel torn
Like a sail in a storm
Without you, I'm just a sad song

[Verse 3: We The Kings & Elena Coats]
You're the perfect melody
The only harmony
I wanna hear
You're my favorite part of me
With you standing next to me
I've got nothing to fear

[Chorus: We The Kings & Elena Coats]
Without you, I feel broke
Like I'm half of a whole
Without you, I've got no hand to hold
Without you, I feel torn
Like a sail in a storm
Without you (Yeah, I'm just a sad song)
Without you, I feel broke
Like I'm half of a whole
Without you, I've got no hand to hold
Without you, I feel torn
Like a sail in a storm
Without you, I'm just a sad song
