5 ContributorsVienna Lyrics[Verse 1]
Slow down, you crazy child
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you're so smart, then tell me
Why are you still so afraid, hmm?
Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You'd better cool it off before you burn it out
You've got so much to do and only so many hours in a day-ay

[Chorus]
But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you could just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?

[Verse 2]
Slow down, you're doing fine
You can't be everything you want to be before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight
Tonight
Too bad but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong
You know you can't always see when you're right
You're right
You might also like[Chorus 2]
You've got your passion, you've got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true, ooh
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?

[Interlude]

[Chorus 3]
Slow down, you crazy child
Take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile
It's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two, ooh
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?

[Chorus 4]
And you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you could just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh
Why don't you realize, Vienna waits for you?
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?Embed
