6 ContributorsTell Me That You Love Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
No more lazy mornings with you lying next to me
No more late night talking before we lay our heads to sleep
No more looking in the mirror with you stepping on my feet
Without your arms around my shoulders, I've lost the strength to be
Come and set me free

[Chorus]
Will you stay with me tonight
And pretend it's all alright?
Tell me that you love me
The way you used to love me
Will you whisper in my ear
Those three words I wanna hear?
Tell me that you love me
The way you used to love me

[Verse 2]
Even if you don't mean it, won't you say I'm still the one?
Hide the way that you're feeling and make believe I still belong
And nothing's changed since you've gone

[Chorus]
Will you stay with me tonight
And pretend it's all alright?
Tell me that you love me
The way you used to love me
Will you whisper in my ear
Those three words I wanna hear?
Tell me that you love me
The way you used to love me
You might also like[Bridge]
One last time to hold you
And one last time to tell you
All the things I should've said before
But just once more...

[Chorus]
Will you stay with me tonight
And pretend it's all alright?
Tell me that you love me
The way you used to love me
(Tell me that you love me)
Will you whisper in my ear
Those three words I wanna hear? (Whoa)
Tell me that you love me
The way you used to love me

[Chorus]
Will you stay with me tonight
And pretend it's all alright?
Tell me that you love me (Tell me that you love me)
The way you used to love me (Tell me that you love me)
Will you whisper in my ear (Oh)
Those three words I wanna hear?
Tell me that you love me
The way you used to love me1Embed
