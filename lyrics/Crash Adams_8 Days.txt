4 Contributors8 Days Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I could buy more time, I would
Spend it all on you, baby, if I could
Every minute with you is too good
I wanna make it last, you're the best I've had

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I'm countin' down the seconds, baby
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I'm wasting all my time

[Chorus]
I'm thinking 'bout you eight days a week
I can't eat, can't drink, can't sleep
It's all that I do, eight days a week
And you're always in my dreams
You know I try and I try
But every day that ends in "Y"
I'm thinking 'bout you
Eight days a week, six, seven, eight days a week

[Verse 2]
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, I want some more
I'ma hold my breath 'til you're at my door
You're the one, no question, I know for sure
Five, four, three, two, ain't nobody in the world, just me and you
There's a hundrеd million things that I wanna do
And that's fax, no printer (Ha-ha)
