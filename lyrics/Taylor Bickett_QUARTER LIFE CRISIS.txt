7 ContributorsQUARTER LIFE CRISIS Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm terrified of rejection
But I get high off attention
I drink my coffee light
'Cause I'm not fuckin' pretentious
Say that I read for fun
But haven't read in months
Say that I'm settlin' down
But I blacked out at brunch

[Pre-Chorus]
I swear sixteen was yesterday
But now I'm closer to twenty-eight
I'm focusin' all of my energy on just stayin' awake

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't mean to keep
Makin' it about me
Everybody feels like this at twenty-three
I know I'm not unique
But I'm a drama queen
I don't why I'm surprised
It's just a quarter-life crisis

[Verse 2]
I'm constantly symptomatic
Mom says it's psychosomatic
That I'm the girl that cried headache
I'm melodramatic as hell
Where's all the talent that I had last decade?
Another gifted kid that burned out in the tenth grade
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Swear that feels like yesterday
I'm just a tired, old cliché
I'm focusin' all of my energy on just bein' okay

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't mean to keep
Makin' it about me
Everybody feels like this at twenty-three
I know I'm not unique
But I'm a drama queen
I don't why I'm surprised
It's just a quarter-life crisis
Mm, oh-oh
It's just a quarter-life crisis

[Bridge]
And I just found out
That someone from my high school is dead
And another one is married with a kid
And the rest are all lyin' on the internet
I fall for it every time
It feels like I'm fallin' behind

[Chorus]
I don't mean to keep
Makin' it about me
Everybody feels like this at twenty-three
I know I'm not unique
But I'm a drama queen, woah
I don't mean to keep
Makin' it about me
Everybody feels like this at twenty-three
I know I'm not unique
But I'm a drama queen
I don't why I'm surprised
It's just a quarter life
Everybody feels like this
It's a quarter life
I don't why I'm surprised
It's just a quarter-life crisisEmbed
