I hear them calling for you
(Ooh, ooh) I hear them calling for you

[Verse 1: Liam, Louis]
I feel the waves getting started
It's a rush inside I can't control
Your eyes keep pulling me in
And I know, I know, I know
Your friends all talking 'bout me
They say I got no chance at all
But your fire is burning deep
In my soul, my soul, my soul

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
I ain't up for debating
Ain't in it for the taking
You got the whole world shaking

[Chorus: Harry, All]
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I try to take them down
But they run and hide, ain't going down without a fight
(Ooh) I hear them calling for you
(Ooh) I hear them callin'
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart, they come straight for your heart
You might also like[Post-Chorus: All]
(Ooh, ooh) I hear them calling for you
(Ooh, ooh) I hear them calling for you

[Verse 2: Liam, Louis, Niall]
I keep on holding tight now
'Cause your body's telling me "Don't let go"
We're gonna be starting up trouble
I know, I know, I know
Just bringing my demons out
More than ever now
Your beauty could start a war
As you walk in the door

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
I ain't up for debating
Ain't in it for the taking
We got the whole world shaking

[Chorus: Harry, All]
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I try to take them down
But they run and hide, ain't going down without a fight
(Ooh) I hear them calling for you
(Ooh) I hear them callin'
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart, they come straight for your heart
[Post-Chorus: All]
(Ooh, ooh) I hear them calling for you
(Ooh, ooh) I hear them calling for you

[Bridge: Niall, Liam, All]
I wish it wasn't true
But the whole world's tryna get a piece of you
And my heart keeps fightin' in this battle of fools
Gotta make it through, gotta make it through

[Chorus: Harry, All]
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I try to take them down
But they run and hide, ain't going down without a fight
(Ooh) I hear them calling for you
(Ooh) I hear them callin'
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart, they come straight for your heart
