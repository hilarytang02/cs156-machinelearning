3 ContributorsLike the Rain Lyrics[Verse 1]
Making small talk on the sidewalk
Stars up in your eyes
Spent the day together
And when it turned to nine
You kissed me but you missed me
Little to the side
I feel like we're starting something tonight

[Chorus]
I want you to fall
Like the rain
Into my arms, I know you're scared to
It's okay
I give you my all
If you feel the same
You make it easier than breathing
Falling like the rain

[Verse 2]
Left your scrunchie in my top drawer
Jacket on my bed
Little make up on it
Haven't cleaned it yet
You pulled me little closer
You let me kiss your neck
Pause just for a moment
And you said
You might also like[Chorus]
I want you to fall
Like the rain
Into my arms, I know you're scared to
It's okay
I give you my all
If you feel the same
You make it easier than breathing
Falling like the rain

[Bridge]
Like water down the mountain side, mhh
The way that birds were meant to fly
Something natural by you and I

[Chorus]
Want me to fall
Like the rain
Stay in my arms, let me hold you
Night and day
I give you my all
When skies are grey
You make it easier than breathing
It's just right
Darling you and I
Falling like the rainEmbed
