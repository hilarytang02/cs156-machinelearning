I-65
Your hand on my leg while your other hand drives
You'd glance to the side
I’d tell you to focus, you'd swerve to the right
That's how it used to be
You’d look at me before you turn the key
But now, I can't help but think
That maybe you fell out of love with me

[Chorus]
'Cause you keep your eyes on the road
Both hands on the wheel, you never let go
You don't like to talk to me when your foot's on the gas
Say you're focusing
I wish we would stop at a red, and you'd turn to say
You love me again
But you keep your eyes on thе road
No matter what color the traffic lights glow

[Verse 2]
I used to hopе
All the lights would be red or yellow
Now I hope for green
So I can pretend that's why you ignore me
You don’t wanna talk
When I get in, you turn the music up
But I still buckle up
I’m holding on but I think that you're done
You might also like[Chorus]
’Cause you keep your eyes on the road
Both hands on the wheel, you never let go
You don't like to talk to me when your foot's on the gas
Say you're focusing
I wish we would stop at a red, and you’d turn to say
You love me again
But you keep your eyes on the road
No matter what color the traffic lights glow

[Bridge]
Every time that you pull up in the drive
I get in your car and think, "Is this the last time?"
I'm holding my breath in the passenger side
Your safe driving has me scared for my life

[Chorus]
'Cause you keep your eyes on the road
Both hands on the wheel, you never let go
You don't like to talk to me when your foot's on the gas
Say you're focusing
I wish we would stop at a red, and you'd turn to say
You love me again
But you keep your eyes on the road
No matter what color the traffic lights glow
[Outro]
No matter what color the traffic lights glow
No matter what color the traffic lights glow3Embed
