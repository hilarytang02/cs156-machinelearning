Five A.M. and I feel like crying
I knew I lost you, I lost a friend
Clock ran out at the worst of timing
I'm deeply troubled, filled with regret

[Pre-Chorus]
Moms knees deep in alcohol
But I'm drowning, I'm drowning, I'm drowning
Sinking deeper need your arms around me, around me

[Chorus]
Cause there ain't nothing in this world
Nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To say one more I love you
Nothing in this world, nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To say one more I love you

[Verse 2]
Thunder hit but it felt like lighting
The night I lost you I lost a friend
And pictures say you look just like me
Wish I could see you, see you again

[Pre-Chorus]
Moms knees deep in alcohol
But I'm drowning, I'm drowning, I'm drowning
Sinking deeper need your arms around me, around me
You might also like[Chorus]
Cause there ain't nothing in this world
Nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To say one more I love you
Nothing in this world, nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To say one more I love you

[Post-Chorus]
One more I love you
One more I love you
Nothing in this world, nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To say one more I love you

[Bridge]
I'm drowning, I'm drowning, I'm drowning
I'm drowning, I'm drowning, I'm drowning

[Chorus]
Cause there ain't nothing in this world
Nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To say one more I love you
Nothing in this world, nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To say one more I love you

[Post-Chorus]
One more I love you
One more I love you
One more I love you
Cause there ain't nothing in this world
Nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To say one more I love you3Embed
