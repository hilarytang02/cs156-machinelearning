30 ContributorsCold Coffee Lyrics[Verse 1]
She's like cold coffee in the morning
I'm drunk off of last night's whiskey and coke
She'll make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke

[Pre-Chorus]
You can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now

[Chorus]
Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to

[Verse 2]
I'll wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside the day is up and calling
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep
