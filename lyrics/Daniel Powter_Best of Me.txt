5 ContributorsBest of Me LyricsI was made the wrong way
Won't you do me the right way?
Where you gonna be tonight?
'Cause I won't stay too long

Maybe you're the life of me
When you talk to me it strikes me
Won't somebody help me?
'Cause I don't feel too strong

Was it something that I said?
Was it something that I did?
Or the combination of both that did me in?

You know I'm hoping you'll sing along
Even if it's not your favorite song
Don't want to be there when there's nothing left to say

You know that some of us spin again
And when you do you need a friend
Don't want to be there when there's nothing left for me
And I hate the thought of finally being erased
But baby that's the best of me

Everything's behind you
But the hopeless signs beside you
I'm living in the moment
Have I wasted all of your time?
