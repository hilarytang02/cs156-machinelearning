1 ContributorAtlanta Lyrics[Verse 1]
Atlanta don't feel the same without ya
Half of my heart stayed back in Georgia

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're so far away
It's a different place
So I wish you had stayed
And there's no one to blame
Just the price that you pay
When the heart is untamed

[Chorus]
Ooh, oh-oh-ooh
Ooh, oh-oh-ooh
If I had never met your eyes
I would've never known the light
Ooh, oh-oh-ooh
Ooh, oh-oh-ooh
If we get another life
Maybe then, we'll have our time
Now that I know what it's like
It's no more wretched than a liе
It's no more wretched than a liе

[Verse 2]
Atlanta will always look just like us
And our love, our last late nights on Francis
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're so far away
It's a different place
So I wish you had stayed
And there's no one to blame
Just the price that you pay
When the heart is untamed (Hey)

[Chorus]
Ooh, oh-oh-ooh
Ooh, oh-oh-ooh
If I had never met your eyes
I would've never known the light
Ooh, oh-oh-ooh
Ooh, oh-oh-ooh
If we get another life
Maybe then, we'll have our time
Now that I know what it's like
It's no more wretched than a lie
It's no more wretched than a lie

[Outro]
Ooh, oh-oh-ooh
Ooh, oh-oh-ooh
Ooh, oh-oh-ooh
Ooh, oh-oh-oohEmbed
