1 ContributorStart of something new / try everything LyricsLiving in my own world

Didn't understand

That anything could happen

When you take a chance

I never believed in what I couldn't see

I never opened my heart (Oh)

To all the possibilities

I know that something has changed

Never felt this way and right here tonight

This could be the start of something new

It feels so right to be here with you (oh)

And now looking in your eyes

I feel in my heart (feel in my heart)

Oh yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

The start of something new

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I mеssed up tonight

I lost another fight

Lost in myself but I'll just start again

I keep falling down

I keep on hitting thе ground

I always get up now to see what's next

Birds don't just fly
They fall down and get up

Nobody learns without getting it wrong

I won't give up, no I won't give in

Till I reach the end

And then I'll start again

No I won't leave

I wanna try everything

I wanna try even though I could fail

Now who'd have ever thought that

We'd both be here tonight

And the world looks so much brighter (brighter)

With you by my side (by my side)

I know that something has changed
Never felt this way

I know it for real

This could be the start of something new

(I won't give up, no I won't give in)

It feels so right to be here with you (oh)

(Till I reach the end, and then I'll start again)

And now looking in your eyes

(No I won't leave, I wanna try everything)

I feel in my heart

(I wanna try even though I could fail)

The start of something new

I didn't know that it could happen till it happened to me (oh no)

I didn't know it before

But now it's easy to see

It's the start of something new

It feels so right to be here with you

And now looking in your eyes I feel in my heart

That it's the start of something new

I won't give up, no I won't give in

Till I reach the end, and then I'll start again

No I won't leave

I wanna try everything

I wanna try even though I could fail

I'll keep on making them every day

Those new mistakes

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Try everything

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

The start of something new

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Aaaah

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
