They say we are what we are
But we don't have to be
I'm bad behavior, but I do it in the best way
I'll be the watcher (Watcher)
Of the eternal flame
I'll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass, glass (Glass)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I try to picture me without you, but I can't

[Chorus]
'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
And live with me forever now
And pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long

[Post-Chorus]
We could be immor—, immortals
Immor—, immortals
Immor—, immortals
Immor—, immortals

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, the only payoff for having any faith
Is when it's tested again and again every day
I'm still comparing your past to my future
It might be your wound, but they're my sutures

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass, glass (Glass)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I try to picture me without you, but I can't

[Chorus]
'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
And live with me forever now
And pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long

We could be immor—, immortals
Immor—, immortals
