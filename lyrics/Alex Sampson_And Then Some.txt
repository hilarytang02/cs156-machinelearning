5 ContributorsAnd Then Some Lyrics[Verse 1]
I could be at a red light
You grab my hand and hold it tight
You look at me and suddenly
There's one or two more butterflies
You're sippin' on a cherry Coke
Barely getting through the joke
That you've told me 10 times this week
But somehow it ain't gettin' old

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say it and I mean it
At least I think I do
It has a different meaning
Every time that you steal another kiss off my lips

[Chorus]
I love you and then somehow I love you more
Spinnin' you around the kitchen floor
Lookin' in your eyes, it hits me out of the blue
I love you and then some nights you say it back
And my heart starts beating twice as fast
Darlin', right when I think I can't keep fallin', I do

[Post-Chorus]
I love you and then some, and then some, and then some
I love you and then some, and then some, and then some
You might also like[Verse 2]
When your hair's a perfect mess
And you wear my hoodie like a dress
When I think it can't happen again
It happens again

[Chorus]
I love you and then somehow I love you more
Spinnin' you around the kitchen floor (Kitchen floor)
Lookin' in your eyes, it hits me out of the blue (Out)
I love you and then some nights you say it back (Say it back)
And my heart starts beating twice as fast (Twice as fast)
Darlin', right when I think I can't keep fallin', I do (Oh)

[Post-Chorus]
I love you and then some, and then some, and then some (I love you)
I love you and then some, and then some, and then some (Then some)

[Bridge]
I love you, and then sometimes, it all multiplies
Just like two times five when your hand's in mine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause then somehow I love you more
Spinnin' you around the kitchen floor
Lookin' in your eyes it
Hits me out of the blue (out of the blue)
[Chorus]
I love you and then some nights you say it back (Say it back)
And my heart starts beating twice as fast (Twice as fast)
Darlin', right when I think I can't keep fallin', I do (I do, I do)

[Post-Chorus]
I love you and then some, and then some, and then some
(I love you, I love you, I love you)
I love you and then some, and then some, and then some
I love you and then some
(I love you, I love you, I love you)1Embed
