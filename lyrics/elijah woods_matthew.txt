Skater shoes and faded Levis
A mixtape of your favorite b-sides
That polaroid of us still lives beside my bed
I know I can't avoid it but I try my best (Mhm)
I wanted to be you back in '05
But it gets hard when you're so little and you're lost
And you're left picking up the pieces
Of a world that kind of stopped

[Chorus]
So why the hell did you leave so fast?
'Cause shooting stars are never meant to crash
Were you in pain and I just couldn't see?
Thought it'd all make sense when I was 23
That you'd be therе when I need you most
Despite a million milеs, would we still be close?
Would you fall in love, make her your wife?
Would you have a kid?
Would they have your eyes?
I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never know

[Verse 2]
The time it passed and I fucking let it
'Cause it still hurts when I don't forget it
The numbers on my chest I put my blood in ink
When I talk about the best I wish it didn't sting (Mhm)
The hardest part is just accepting
That this shits hard
'Cause I'm good and then I'm not
Looking for reasons in the pieces of the you that I've still got
You might also like[Chorus]
So why the hell did you leave so fast?
'Cause shooting stars are never meant to crash
Were you in pain and I just couldn't see?
Thought it'd all make sense when I was 23
That you'd be there when I need you most
Despite a million miles, would we still be close?
Would you fall in love, make her your wife?
Would you have a kid?
Would they have your eyes?
I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never know1Embed
