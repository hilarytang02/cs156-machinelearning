7 ContributorsIf Youâ€™re Hearing This Lyrics[Intro: Parson James & Betty Who]
We all wanna believe
Wanna believe in somethin'
'Cause if we believe in nothin'
Then what do we have? What do we have?
We all wanna be loved
All wanna love somebody
'Cause if we ain't got nobody
Then what do we have? What do we have?

[Verse 1: Parson James]
If you're hearin' this
I'm at King and 5th
Eight to ten, I'll sit
At this table for two
In a Dodgers cap
Drinkin' coffee black
Wonderin' where you're at

[Chorus: Parson James]
I'll be waitin', be waitin' for you
I've been waitin', been waitin' for you

[Refrain: Parson James & Betty Who]
We all wanna believe
Wanna believe in somethin'
'Cause if we believe in nothin'
Then what do we have? What do we have?
We all wanna be loved
All wanna love somebody
'Cause if we ain't got nobody
Then what do we have? What do we have?

If you're hearin' this
Know I'm listenin'
I'm still wanderin'
Down these lost avenues
But I know one day
Clear blue skies are grey
I'll walk in and you'll say

[Chorus: Betty Who & Parson James]
I've been waitin', been waitin' for you
You
I've been waitin', been waitin' for you
For you

[Bridge: Parson James & Betty Who]
If you're hearin' this
I'm at King and 5th
Eight to ten, I'll sit
At this table for two
But I know one day
Clear blue skies are grey
I'll walk in and you'll say

[Chorus: Parson James, Betty Who & Both]
I've been waitin', been waitin' for you
For you
I've been waitin', been waitin' for you (Oh)
For you
I've been waitin', been waitin' for you7Embed
