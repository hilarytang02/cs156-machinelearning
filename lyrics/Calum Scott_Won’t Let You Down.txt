13 ContributorsWonâ€™t Let You Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
The love of your life
He's treating you wrong
You stand by his side
He lies all along

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the fairytale you want
But the glimmer in your eyes have gone
And now you're alone, I'll lend you my shoulder to cry on

[Chorus]
I won't let you down, this time around
I'll show you how, oh, no matter how far
I don't care where you are, I won't let you down

[Verse 2]
Thanks for the tears, the pain that you caused her
And now you're just a memory
An old familiar melody she's heard before

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a fairytale you ended
Done with your pretending, you're the fool
Oh, you're the fool
And now she's alone, I'll give her my hand to hold on to

And I see it now, my eyes are open
I'm all yours, tears have spoken
I can't fix all that is broken
My feet on the ground
But I won't let you down, this time around
And I'll show you how, oh, and no matter how far

[Chorus/Outro]
But I won't let you down, this time around
And I'll show you how, oh, no matter how far
I don't care where you are, I won't let you downEmbed
