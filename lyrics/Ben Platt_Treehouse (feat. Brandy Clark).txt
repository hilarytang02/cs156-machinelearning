3 ContributorsTreehouse Lyrics[Verse 1: Ben Platt]
Love is a treehouse
Kind of a gamble to get in
That you-and-me house
Little bit closer to heaven
You've never seen clouds
Right outside of your window

[Verse 2: Ben Platt & Brandy Clark]
Love is a treehouse
One of a kind that you have to
See to believe house
All of the climbing is past you
And you can breathe now
Somewhere only we go

[Chorus: Ben Platt, Ben Platt & Brandy Clark]
The roots may be strong and the branches are sturdy
It don’t make a difference
You're still at the mercy of the wind and rain
But isn't thе danger the reason wе do it?
We know we could fall but we’re holding on to it
That's the risk we take
'Cause hearts don't bend, they break

[Verse 3: Ben Platt & Brandy Clark]
Love is a treehouse
Don't take money to build it
Move-in for free house
Might be small but it's filled with
All that you need now
We'll watch the world keep changing
Just like the leaves now from our treehouse
You might also like[Chorus: Brandy Clark, Ben Platt & Brandy Clark]
The roots may be strong and the branches are sturdy
It don't make a difference
We’re still at the mercy of the wind and rain
But isn’t the danger the reason we do it?
We know we could fall but we're holding on to it
That’s the risk we take
'Cause hearts don't bend, they break

[Bridge: Ben Platt & Brandy Clark]
Hm-mm-mm
I'd rather take the chance of crashing than be standing safe on the ground
Just staring up and wishing I was feeling all I’m feeling right now

[Chorus: Brandy Clark, Ben Platt, Ben Platt & Brandy Clark]
The roots may be strong and the branches are sturdy
It don't make a difference
We're still at the mercy of the wind and rain
But isn't the danger the reason we do it?
We know we could fall but we're holding on to it
That's the risk we take
'Cause hearts don't bend, they break

[Outro: Ben Platt & Brandy Clark]
