4 Contributors​fish on your line Lyrics[Verse 1]
The radio is shot and the windows don't go down
The engine lights on and the breaks always squeak
It ain't worth a lot but I get by just fine now
'Cause wherever I'm going I know you're with me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just a fish on your line, baby don't throw me back
Water to wine and you're pouring a glass

[Chorus]
You're a sugar rush, like a honeydew
When I'm coming home babe I'm coming to you
You're a sing-a-long on a Friday night
You be the lyrics and I'll be the rhyme, like

[Verse 2]
I got a fridge from my mommas and a couch from '85
The front door don't lock and there's holes in the screen
The a/c won't work no morе, the neighbors are too loud
But I don't pay no mind bеcause you're here with me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just a fish on your line, baby don't throw me back
Water to wine and you're pouring a glass
You might also like[Chorus]
You're a sugar rush, like a honeydew
When I'm coming home babe I'm coming to you
You're a sing-a-long on a Friday night
You be the lyrics and I'll be the rhyme, like
