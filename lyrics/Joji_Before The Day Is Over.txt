I don't know what you wanna hear
Things changing course, smiles fade to grin
Now the moment's gone, just as I feared
And I was hoping, and I was hoping this time

[Verse 2]
No longer here, we were feeling bliss
Don't hold your tongue, there's no time for tricks
You've been closing up, I expected this
But I was hoping that you'd stay open this time

[Chorus]
I know it won't be long
I know you're almost gone
Hold on, let me in before the day is over
Just let me in before the day is over

[Verse 3]
Say something soon, we might lose it all
Something we can use to break our fall
There's nothing left to do when we start to stall
And I was hoping that we could hold it this time

[Chorus]
I know it won't be long
I know you're almost gone
Hold on, let me in before the day is over
Just let me in before the day is over
Let me in, let me in
Just let me in before the day is over

I can't take another day
I could go insane
There's only so much I can take
I can't live this way
I can't take another day
I could go insane
There's only so much I can take
I can't live this way

[Chorus]
Let me in, let me in (I know it won't be long)
Just let me in before the day is over (I know you're almost gone)
Let me in, let me in
Just let me in before the day is over9Embed
