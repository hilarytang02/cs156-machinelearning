9 Contributors11:11 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Is it late?
Eleven minutes past 11
It's both always but never our time
Nothing to regret
The rest just might be heaven
You're always but never really mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You stopped my heart from fifty feet
It pumped and sang and skipped a beat
And when I sleep, my soul you keep

[Chorus]
I wish for you to be happy
I wish for you to be free
I wish for you to be fearless
That's wishes one, two, and three
And I won't wish to be yours or for you to be mine
But I'll wish them all for you every time

[Verse 2]
Is it warm? Clouds but the sun's in the sky
Rises ovеr mine but sets with you
When it's dark I'll try not to ask you why or what you'll do
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You stoppеd my heart from fifty feet
It pumped and sang and skipped a beat
And when I sleep, my soul you keep

[Chorus]
I wish for you to be happy
I wish for you to be free
I wish for you to be fearless
That's wishes one, two, and three
And I won't wish to be yours or for you to be mine
But I'll wish them all for you every time

[Bridge]
If one day the stars align, you feel ready to be mine
I hope you'll find the strength to come
With trumpets, pipe and drum
You stopped my heart from fifty feet
It pumped and sang and skipped a beat
And when I sleep, my soul you keep
No, and I won't wish to be yours or for you to be mine
But I'll wish them all for you every time

[Outro]
Yes, I'll wish them all for you every time
Oh, I'll wish them all for you every time5Embed
