It's been way too long for me to find it this hard
Sitting alone, my fingers pickin' the sofa apart
In attempt to distract from the fact that I miss you
I wonder if your friends have had to carry you home
And stay for the night because they don't wanna leave you alone
Where before it was fun, it's becomin' an issue

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's cruel
But I kind of hope you're tortured too

[Chorus]
Tell me, does your heart stop at the party when my name drops
Like you stood at the platform and the trains cross?
Are you hurting? Yeah, you must be
Or is it just me?
Tongue-tied, screamin' on the inside
When I say that we broke up and they ask why
Are you cryin' in the shower like a freak?
Or is it just me?

[Verse 2]
I heard a rumour you'd been spending some time
With that blonde girl you work with and I know she's exactly your type
And my miserable mind's running wild with the picture
Or are you there by yourself, dialing, redialing my number?
End up calling your mother, spilling tears on my jumper again
The way I am

I know it's cruel
But I kind of hope you're tortured too

[Chorus]
Tell me, does your heart stop at the party when my name drops
Like you stood at the platform and the trains cross?
Are you hurting? Yeah, you must be
Or is it just me?
Tongue-tied, screamin' on the inside
When I say that we broke up and they ask why
Are you cryin' in the shower like a freak?
Or is it just me?

[Bridge]
'Cause this would be one whole lot easier
God, I know that's selfish but it's true
If underneath some calm exterior
You're all fucked up too

[Chorus]
Tell me, does your heart stop at the party when my name drops
Like you stood at the platform and the trains cross?
Are you hurting? Yeah, you must be
Or is it just me?
Tongue-tied, screamin' on the inside
When I say that we broke up and they ask why
Are you cryin' in the shower like a freak?
With only cigarettes for company?
Are you cryin' in the shower like a freak?
Or is it just me?5Embed
