5 ContributorsPictures of Mountains Lyrics[Verse 1]
I sit in my car outside restaurants and bars
Reading about what's inside
I look opinions 'bout news and religion
So I don't have to use my own mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I should call my friends
But I read their posts instead

[Chorus]
Like dancing a waltz with no partner
Nobody's holding your hand
Like singing duets as a solo
The harmony's just in your head

It's almost as if I have been everywhere
Almost tasting the food, almost breathing the air
But nobody's heart ever pounded
From the feeling of being surrounded by pictures of mountains

[Verse 2]
People are messy and life can get heavy
It's easier to keep it online
Like checking the weather to see if it's better
Instead of just going outside

Pretend I'm unaware
But the truth is that I'm scared

[Chorus]
Like dancing a waltz with no partner
Nobody's holding your hand
Like singing duets as a solo
The harmony's just in your head

It's almost as if I have been everywhere
Almost tasting the food, almost breathing the air
But nobody's heart ever pounded
From the feeling of being surrounded by pictures of mountains

[Bridge]
Everyone's right here on my phone
So why do I still feel so alone?

[Chorus]
A waltz with no partner
Nobody's holding your hand
A duet's just a solo
If the harmony is all in your head

I thought that I knew what a mountain was like
'till I stood in the valley and looked up at the sky
[Outro]
And I felt my heart beating faster
That feeling I've been chasing after
Something that no one can capture
In pictures of mountainsEmbed
