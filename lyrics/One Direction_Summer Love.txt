41 ContributorsSummer Love Lyrics[Intro: Zayn, Liam, Zayn & Liam]
Yeah
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Zayn]
Can't believe you're packing your bags
Trying so hard not to cry
Had the best time, and now it's the worst time
But we have to say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus 1: Harry]
Don't promise that you're gonna write
Don't promise that you'll call
Just promise that you won't forget we had it all

[Chorus: Zayn]
'Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember

[Post-Chorus: Zayn, All]
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love

[Verse 2: Louis]
Wish that we could be alone now
If we could find some place to hide
Make the last time just like the first time
Push a button and rewind

Don't say the word that's on your lips
Don't look at me that way
Just promise you'll remember when the sky is grey

[Chorus: Zayn, All]
'Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember

[Post-Chorus: All, Zayn]
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love

[Bridge: Zayn & Liam, Zayn & Harry]
So, please, don't make this any harder
We can't take this any further
And I know there's nothing that I wanna change, change

[Chorus: Zayn & Harry, Zayn, Harry, All]
'Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember (Will remember)
[Post-Chorus: Zayn, All, Louis, Niall, *Harry*]
You were my summer love (Summer love)
You always will be my summer love (Summer love)
You always will be my summer love (*Yeah*)
