Yo, turn that up
'Til the world gets sick of us
'Til the world gets sick of us

[Verse 1]
We watched Shrek 2 over Zoom, you were in your bedroom
Told you looked cute but your face turned blue
So scared, so scared that they're all against us (All against us)
I'm here, right here, never on your own
And I'm here, right here, whispered through the phone
No fear, no fear, I'll protect us
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
I'm here when the walls start closin'
I'm here when the sky starts fallin' down
We'll dance through a broken city
We'll scream 'til the world gets sick of us

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
'Til the world gets sick of us
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
We'll scream 'til the world gets, world gets

Too young, so young, what do we both know
'Bout love, true love and the way it grows
It's been so clear, we're above this, yeah (Wow)

[Chorus]
I'm here when the walls start closin'
I'm here when the sky starts fallin' down
We'll dance through a broken city
We'll scream 'til the world gets sick of us

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
'Til the world gets sick of us
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
We'll scream 'til the world gets, world gets

[Chorus]
I'm here when the walls start closin'
I'm here when the sky starts fallin' down
We'll dance through a broken city
We'll scream 'til the world gets sick of us
I'm here when the walls start closin'
I'm here when the sky starts fallin' down
We'll dance through a broken city
We'll scream 'til the world gets sick of us
