I think it sucks that you're perfect
'Cause you're not perfect for me
And though you kill me with kindness
It ain't the kind that I need
I know we look good on paper
Until you give us a read
'Cause when we pull back the curtains
There ain't a whole lot to see

[Chorus]
I wanna love you but I don't
I wanna need you but I won't
I begged my heart to start to race when I'm kissing you
I say I'm dreaming 'bout your face, but it isn't you

[Verse 2]
And I'm not trying to change you
But it's just not in the stars
I know there's somebody out there
To love you just as you are
When you finally find that someone who fits you right
You'rе gonna see I couldn't be him
No matter how hard I try
I know I wanna love you but I-
I wanna lovе you but I-

I wanna love you but I don't
I wanna need you but I won't
I begged my heart to start to race when I'm kissing you
I say I'm dreaming 'bout your face, but it isn't you
I wanna love you but I don't
You gotta let me let you go
'Cause I can't look you in the eye for another day
Won't stay forever, so goodbye is the only way
I wanna love you but I don't

[Refrain]
I wanna love you
I wanna, I wanna
I wanna love you
I wanna love you but I don't
I wanna love you
I wanna, I wanna
I wanna love you

[Chorus]
I wanna love you but I don't
I wanna need you but I won't
I beg my heart to start to race when I'm kissing you
I say I'm dreaming 'bout your face, but it isn't you
I wanna love you but I don't
You gotta let me let you go
'Cause I can't look you in the eye for another day
Won't stay forever, so goodbye is the only way
I wanna love you but I don't

I wanna love you
I wanna, I wanna
I wanna love you
I wanna love you but I don't
I wanna love you
