Say it's not enough to be in love
You need to prove it somehow
It's not dollar signs or pick up lines
Or anything that you could kiss away now

[Chorus]
That sinking feeling that you get
When you say something you'll regret
'Cause you were jealous of some stranger
That she met when you were gone
You feel insane
'Cause love is pain

[Verse 2]
Say it's not okay to feel that way
It's real, you may not make her happy
So what's wrong with me? If honestly
I wanna be the only way she can be

[Chorus]
That hollow feeling in your chest
As you both wordlessly undress
After a fight, it's getting late
You tried your bеst, but then she cried
And you'rе to blame
And love is pain
You might also like[Bridge]
Don't believe anyone
Who tells you any different
If it's easy, if it's fun
Something's missing

[Verse 3]
There's this dream I've had 'bout mom and dad
Makes me so sad, I wake up crying
Can't believe I'll have to live through that
Wish it wasn't mandatory dying

[Chorus]
We go through life, we play pretend
Act like it doesn't have to end
It's all alright until your friend runs a red light
You watch his car burst into flames
