2 ContributorsI Found Her LyricsI found love in the loneliest
City on earth
Where people hurt people so they
Don’t feel hurt
I found her
In the loneliest city on earth

I remember winter nights
Being wrapped up in your eyes
Yeah, the way we watched the world go by
Wish I could have changed your mind

I found love in the loneliest
City on earth
Where people hurt people so they
Don’t feel hurt
Lost my soul to the city when she
Said goodbye
Oh, it hurts to know our timing
Wasn’t right
She was the only one, one
Of a kind
I found her
In the loneliest city on earth

In silence love
Our distance grows
Goodbyes don’t hit the same way anymore
And heaven knows
How two let go
But this city never felt like home
