20 ContributorsRun Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
They met at school, that's how it goes
Some drinks and then a rose
Then plans to meet again
He wrote her poems, songs, and prose
She knew that he'd propose
She only wondered when

[Pre-Chorus]
One night, before they went to bed
He kneeled on both knees
And this is what he said

[Chorus]
I may not be wise
And I won't save the day
But look in my eyes
And know I'll always stay
And I won't run away
I won't run away

[Verse 2]
Some years went by, they had a child
He was funny, strange, and mild
Their love for him ran deep
Some nights, his dreams would drive him wild
So into bed, she piled
To help him fall asleep
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
One night, he couldn't get to bed
So she kneeled on both knees
And this is what she said

[Chorus]
I may not be wise
And I won't save the day
But look in my eyes
And know I'll always stay
And I won't run away
I won't run away

[Bridge]
You say it's safer on your own
You'd rather sleep alone
Then grow to need me there
But I hope now you can see
What my mom and dad showed me
I'm not going anywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
I love you more and more each day
To love is not to leave
So hear me when I say
[Chorus]
I may not be wise
And I won't save the day
But look in my eyes
And know I'll always stay
And I won't run away
I won't run awayEmbed
