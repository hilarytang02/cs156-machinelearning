So your friend's been telling me
You've been sleepin' with my sweater
And that you can't stop missin' me
Bet my friend's been telling you
I'm not doin' much better
Because I'm missin' half of me

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
And bein' here without you
Is like I'm wakin' up to

[Chorus: Zayn]
Only half a blue sky
Kinda there, but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man, at best
With half an arrow in my chest
'Cause I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

[Verse 2: Louis, Zayn]
Forget all we said that night
No, it doesn't even matter
'Cause we both got split in two
If you could spare an hour or so
We'll go for lunch down by the river
We can really talk it through

And bein' here without you
Is like I'm wakin' up to

[Chorus: Harry & Niall]
Only half a blue sky
Well, kinda there, but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man, at best
With half an arrow in my chest
'Cause I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

[Post-Chorus: Harry]
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a heart without you

[Bridge: Niall]
Though I try to get you out of my head
The truth is, I got lost without you
And since then, I've been wakin' up to

[Chorus: All, Niall, Liam]
Only half a blue sky (Only half a blue sky)
Kinda there, but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man, at best (I'm half a man, at best)
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you
[Outro: Zayn & Liam, Zayn, Liam, Harry]
Without you, without you
Half a heart without you (Without you, without you)
Without you, without you
I'm half a heart without you53Embed
