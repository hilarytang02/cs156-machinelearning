Known each other since forever
You always seemed to have my heart
You said that we'd end up together
But I never knew where to start

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time you find somebody
And tell me how you think they're the one
You hard for me to take
You loved me in a way that I don't want

[Chorus]
You look at me like I'm someone
You only need when it goes wrong
But you look at him like he's your missing piece
And darling, I wish it was me
I wish it was me

[Verse 2]
Always hoped I'd be the reason
The reason you can't sleep at night
The one you miss so much, you're barely breathing
The face you see when you turn out the lights

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time you've got nobody
I'm thinking maybe I could be the one
It's hard for me to take
You loved me in a way that I don't want
You might also like[Chorus]
You look at me like I'm someone
You only need when it goes wrong
But you look at him like he's your missing piece
And darling, I wish it was me

[Post-Chorus]
The music fades, the lights come on
And I just want to take you home
But you whispered to him that you're ready to leave
And darling, I wish it was me, I wish it was me

[Bridge]
And I almost told you about a million times
Always tripping over words I never seem to find
Just a little closer, it's getting harder to hide
I keep losing the lines
But the answer's right there in your eyes

[Chorus]
You look at me like I'm someone
You only need when it goes wrong
But you look at him like he's your missing piece
And darling, I wish it was me
Oh, you look at me like I'm someone
You only need when it goes wrong
But you look at him like he's your missing piece
And darling, I wish it was me
[Post-Chorus]
The music fades, the lights come on
And I just want to take you home
But you whispered to him that you're ready to leave
And darling, I wish it was me, I wish it was meEmbed
