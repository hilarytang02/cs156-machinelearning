5 ContributorsLove You ’Til Death Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes you get a feeling deep down in your soul
You were wearing crimson lipstick, left your perfume on my clothes
So I promised you forever, not knowing how it'd go
Lord knows that I ain't lying just to keep you on your toes

[Pre-Chorus]
There was no one there before you
And no one's coming close

[Chorus]
If I was playing God, we'd have a thousand years ahead
But I can't, so I'll adore you every day that we have left
And when judgment comes to take me, well, I won't play hard to get
Knowing that I, knowing that I loved you right 'til death
I'll lovе you 'til death
I'll love you 'til death

[Verse 2]
'Til our bonеs are old and aching, and we're three feet in the ground
Maybe halfway up to heaven, maybe we're still coming down
Lots of things are changing, yeah, nothing stays the same
But I'll keep falling just as quickly as the day you took my name

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there was no one there before you
And no one's ever coming close
You might also like[Chorus]
If I was playing God, we'd have a thousand years ahead
But I can't, so I'll adore you every day that we have left
And when judgment comes to take me, well, I won't play hard to get
Knowing that I, knowing that I loved you right 'til death
I'll love you 'til death
I'll love you 'til death
I'll love you, I'll love you 'til death
I'll love you, oh, I'll love you 'til death
I'll love you 'til death

[Chorus]
If I was playing God, I swear that time would never end
But I can't, so I'll adore you for every second I have left
When I promised you forever, what it is I really meant
Was I'll love you
I'll love you 'til deathEmbed
