Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But, baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars
Yeah, we'll be countin' stars"

[Verse 1]
I see this life like a swingin' vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashin' signs
Seek it out and ye shall find

[Refrain]
The old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doin' what we're told

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel somethin' so right doin' the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong doin' the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

[Chorus]
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But, baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars"
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But, baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be, we'll be countin' stars", yeah
