Never take me back to 16
'Cause I’m proud to be a little happy now

[Verse 1]
The past 5 years have felt the same
I’m running, trying to escape
But my brain gets faster everyday
They told me there’s no rain in LA
I got lost trying to change the world
Now I’m back home, piecing the broken pieces
The sky’s still dark but it’s clearing
I crashed the car but I’m healing

[Pre Chorus]
I ain’t there yet
But I’m proud to be a little happy now

[Chorus]
Never take me back to 16
'Cause I’m proud to be a little happy now
I’m learning to love again
But this time for myself
I'm just proud that I'm still here
It might not be much but it's huge for me
Never take me back to 16
'Cause I’m proud to be a little happy now

I’m back home looking at the walls
My face cut out of all the pictures
My high school friends all think I'm dead
They aren't wrong for the version they knew back then
I always thought I'd change the world
But turns out i'm just an ordinary girl
That gets anxious eating out with friends
And still cries when the party ends
But I’m proud to be a little happy now

[Chorus]
Never take me back to 16
'Cause I’m proud to be a little happy now
I’m learning to love again
But this time for myself
I'm just proud that I'm still here
It might not be much but it's huge for me
Never take me back to 16
'Cause I’m proud to be a little happy now

[Bridge]
I'm smiling again
Pain doesn't feel the same
I can feel again
It still hurts, but it's okay
[Chorus]
Never take me back to 16
'Cause I’m proud to be a little happy now
I’m learning to love again
But this time for myself
I'm just proud that I'm still here
It might not be much but it's huge for me
Never take me back to 16
'Cause I’m proud to be a little happy now

[Outro]
It’s been a fight against myself
Learning to love again
It might not be much
But I’m proud to be a little happy nowEmbed
