Worrying works in mysterious ways
Sneakin' up on me when I think that I'm safe
But I know a feelin', it's sort of a place
A loophole when I need to escape

[Pre-Chorus]
Everytime I wanna get a little peace of mind
All I gotta do is close my eyes
And suddenly I'm

[Chorus]
Dancin' in my childhood bedroom
Fallin' right back into the way it was
Dancin' like I never get to
Step into my mind and suddenly I'm

[Verse 2]
Back in the chaos and out of my head
The heavy in my chest is a feather instead
Better equipped for whatever comes next
And if I need to, I can go there again

[Pre-Chorus]
Everytime I wanna get a little peace of mind
All I gotta do is close my eyes
And suddenly I'm

Dancin' in my childhood bedroom
Fallin' right back into the way it was
Dancin' like I never get to
Step into my mind and suddenly I'm
Barefoot on my dark blue carpet
Temporary freedom within these walls
Every time I think I've lost it
Step into my mind and suddenly I'm

[Bridge]
Somewhere else (Somewhere else), somewhere else
With no one else (No one else), no one else
I'm somewhere else (Somewhere else), somewhere else
With no one else (No one else), no one else
And suddenly I'm

[Chorus]
Dancin' in my childhood bedroom
Fallin' right back into the way it was
Dancin' like I never get to
Step into my mind and suddenly
I'm barefoot on my dark blue carpet
Temporary freedom within these walls
Every time I think I've lost it
Step into my mind and suddenly I'm-
[Outro]
(Somewhere else) With
(No one else) I'm
(Somewhere else) With
