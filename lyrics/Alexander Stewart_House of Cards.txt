6 ContributorsHouse of Cards Lyrics[Verse 1]
Changing flights and changing my mind every day
I cope with the pain but to be honest, things don't feel the same
Since you left LA

[Pre-Chorus]
All the stars couldn't lead me where you are
Should've known that in the dark I'd be too dumb to see
Even though you're laying next to me, can't give me what I need, oh
And God I have some questions

[Chorus]
How many drinks does it take to walk away?
How many times will I fuck it up and stay?
I don't know how to love you from afar, you have my heart
'Til we fall just like a house of cards
Of cards

[Verse 2]
Call your bluff, tell me who are you trying to convince
It's not enough if your words never lead you to commit
You know it feels like shit

[Pre-Chorus]
All the stars couldn't lead me where you are
Should've known that in the dark I'd be too dumb to see
Even though you're laying next to me, can't give me what I need
And God I have some questions

How many drinks does it take to walk away?
How many times will I fuck it up and stay?
I don't know how to love you from afar, you have my heart
'Til we fall just like a house of cards
Of cards, of cards, of cards

[Bridge]
If we're made of paper, there's bound to be flames
I'll hold us together, but is it in vain?
If one gust of wind could be all that it takes, oh
If we're made of paper, there's bound to be flames
I'll hold us together, but is it in vain?
If one gust of wind could be all that it takes
All that it takes, all that it takes

[Chorus]
How many drinks does it take to walk away?
How many times will I fuck it up and stay?
I don't know how to love you from afar, you have my heart
'Til we fall just like a house of cards
Of cards, of cards, of cardsEmbed
