Insecure in her skin
Like a puppet, a girl on a string
Broke away, learned to fly
If you want her back, gotta let her shine

[Pre-Chorus]
So it looks like the joke's on you
'Cause the girl that you thought you knew

[Chorus]
She's so gone
That's so over now
She's so gone
You won't find her around
You can look but you won't see the
Girl I used to be, 'cause she
She's so gone

[Verse 2]
Here I am, this is me
And I'm stronger than you ever thought I'd be
Are you shocked? Are you mad?
That you're missing out on who I really am

[Pre-Chorus]
Now it looks like the joke's on you
'Cause the girl that you thought you knew

Like history

Baby, this is me, yeah

[Chorus]
She's so gone
That's so over now
She's so gone
You won't find her around
You can look but you won't see the
Girl I used to be, 'cause she
She's so go-o-o-one
She's so go-o-o-one
You can look but you won't see the
Girl I used to be, 'cause she

So long, she's so gone
Gone, gone, gone5Embed
