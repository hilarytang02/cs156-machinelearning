I'm gonna pick up the pieces and build a LEGO house
If things go wrong, we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings, but there's one thing on my mind
It's all for you, mh

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I will mend ya
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

[Chorus]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now, now

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna paint you by numbers and colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it, and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it, but I've been here before
Now, I'll surrender up my heart, and swap it for yours

I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I'll mend ya
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down

I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done

I will love you better now98Embed
