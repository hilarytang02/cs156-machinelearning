Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars
And let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, darling, kiss me

Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for, all I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for, all I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In another words, I love you
In another words, I love youYou might also likeEmbed
