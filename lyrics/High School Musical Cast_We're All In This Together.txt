Oh, alright, here we go
Together, together
Together, everyone
Together, together
Come on, let's have some fun
Together, we're there for
Each other every time
Together, together
Come on, let's do this right

[Verse 1: Troy & Gabriella]
Here and now, it's time for celebration
I finally figured out (yeah, yeah)
That all our dreams (Uh) have no limitations
That's what it's all about (Come on, now)
Everyone (Oh) is special in their own way
We make each other strong (We make each other strong)
We're not the same, we're different in a good way
Together's where we belong

[Chorus: All]
We're all in this together
Once we know that we are, we're all stars
And we see that
We're all in this together
And it shows when we stand hand in hand
Make our dreams come true
