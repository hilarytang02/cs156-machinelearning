Suddenly you're nowhere to be found
I turn around and everything has changed
Looking for a way to work it out
I'm trying to find some peace to navigate

[Chorus]
The oak tree where I met you
And the writing on the statue
I still remember every word you said
I'm not a soldier, but I'm fighting
Can you hear me through the silence?
I won't give up 'cause there will be a day
We'll meet again

[Post-Chorus]
We'll meet again

[Verse 2]
Everything we wanted turned to gold (Turned to gold)
The path we chose, the future on our side
Never thought I'd do this on my own (On my own)
But now I wield the sword you left behind

[Chorus]
The oak tree where I met you
And the writing on the statue
I still remember every word you said
I'm not a soldier, but I'm fighting
Can you hear me through the silence?
I won't give up 'cause there will be a day
We'll meet again
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
We'll meet again

[Bridge]
Dark for the sunrise
Clouds for a blue sky
Space for the travelling star
Strong from the inside
You're still my life-line
I feel you wherever you are

[Chorus]
The oak tree where I met you
And the writing on the statue
I still remember every word you said
I'm not a soldier, but I'm fighting
Can you hear me through the silence?
I won't give up 'cause there will be a day
We'll meet again

[Post-Chorus]
We'll meet again
