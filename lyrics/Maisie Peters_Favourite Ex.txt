21 ContributorsFavourite Ex Lyrics[Verse 1]
It was open and closing
And hopelessly hoping for shore
We were here, we were ghosting
Both of us coasting on 'just give a little more'

[Pre Chorus]
It was all out my hands when you pulled the trigger
And I kissed your friends 'cause your friends said you kissed her
And I didn't flinch, and the lights didn't flicker and I
I fell apart

[Chorus]
You were my best nights and worst fights
And couldn't care less
You were my gold rush to cold touch
Favourite ex
And all of the others cancel out each other
And it's always you left
You were my no sleep, cried for weeks
Favourite ex

[Verse 2]
It was stabs in the back
And the nice things you said when you were wasted
I was looking for something
And changing the one thing you hated
You might also like[Pre Chorus]
It was all out my hands when you pulled the trigger
And I kissed your friends 'cause your friends said you kissed her
And I didn't flinch, and the lights didn't flicker and I
I fell apart

[Chorus]
And you were my best nights and worst fights
And couldn't care less
You were my gold rush to cold touch
Favourite ex
And all of the others cancel out each other
And it's always you left
You were my no sleep, cried for weeks
Favourite ex

[Bridge]
My favourite ex
(2...3...)

[Chorus]
You were my best nights and worst fights
And deepest breaths
You were my gold rush to cold touch
Favourite ex
And all of the others cancel out each other
And it's always you left
'Cause you were my no sleep, cried for weeks
