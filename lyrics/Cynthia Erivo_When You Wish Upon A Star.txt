10 ContributorsWhen You Wish Upon A Star Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you

[Verse 2]
If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

[Bridge]
Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing

[Verse 3]
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come trueSee Cynthia Erivo LiveGet tickets as low as $40You might also likeEmbed
