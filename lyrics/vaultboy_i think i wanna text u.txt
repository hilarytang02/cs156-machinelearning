10 Contributorsi think i wanna text u Lyrics[Verse 1]
I think I wanna text you
But I don't know what I would say
We didn't leave it on the best note
But I don't wanna be afraid
Remember talking after midnight?
Remember tryna stay awake?
Remember feeling just a little bit less alone on the next day?

[Chorus]
'Cause I do, I, eh
Every second with you running circles in my brain
I do, I, eh
Do you remember all the plans we made?
I do

[Verse 2]
I think I wanna call you
I wonder if you'd call me back
'Cause I can hear it when you're smiling
And I can feel it whеn you're mad
Remembеr talking about our exes?
Remember laughing through the pain?
Remember feeling just a little bit less alone on the next day?

[Chorus]
'Cause I do, I, eh
Every second with you running circles in my brain
I do, I, eh
Do you remember all the plans we made?
I do
You might also like[Bridge]
Up late for no damn reason
I always end up thinking
You're still the only person that's living rent-free inside my head
Don't know if I'm still healing
But I wonder what you're feeling
And if you had a reason, would you wanna see me?
'Cause I would
I would

[Chorus]
'Cause I do, I, eh
Every second with you running circles in my brain
I do, I, eh
Do you remember all the plans we made?
I do

[Outro]
I do, I
I do, I
I do, I, eh
Do you remember all the plans we made?
I doEmbed
[Verse 1]
I think I wanna text you
But I don't know what I would say
We didn't leave it on the best note
But I don't wanna be afraid
Remember talking after midnight?
Remember tryna stay awake?
Remember feeling just a little bit less alone on the next day?

[Chorus]
'Cause I do, I, eh
Every second with you running circles in my brain
I do, I, eh
Do you remember all the plans we made?
I do
