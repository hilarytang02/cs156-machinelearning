3 Contributorsâ€‹wildfire Lyrics[Verse 1]
Found you 'bout a year ago now
I was headed West and you
Were living in that place downtown
I was so depressed in L.A
Living in the mess I made and then you turned it all around

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what have I done?
'Cause I don't deserve someone like you
You can have anyone, but I'm the one you chose

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, uh-oh
It's only gonna burn brighter
Uh-oh, uh-oh
'Cause your love is like wildfire
Oh-oh, oh-oh
It's only gonna burn brighter
Uh-oh, uh-oh
'Cause your love is like wildfire

[Verse 2]
Drove out to your parents last night
Your mom is such a saint, and oh
Your dad is just a stand up guy
And baby, I don't like anyone
So why is this different?
Usually try to stay distant
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what have I done?
'Cause I don't deserve someone like you
You can have anyone, but I'm the one you chose

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, uh-oh
It's only gonna burn brighter
Uh-oh, uh-oh
'Cause your love is like wildfire
Uh-oh, uh-oh
It's only gonna burn brighter
Uh-oh, uh-oh
'Cause your love is like wildfireEmbed
