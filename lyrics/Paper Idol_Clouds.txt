1 ContributorClouds Lyrics[Verse One]
Sweet dreams, bad as it seems
I can ship my mind to a new location
Heart break, made a mistake
We can fix this good as new
She speaks, it makes me weak
Every word drips out, no explanation
Lips shake, she made a mistake
Now I don't know what to do

[Bridge]
Loving you was easy 'til you got yourself thinking out loud
Now you got me with my head in the clouds

[Chorus]
You got me with my head in the clouds
With my head in the clouds

[Verse Two]
Raindrops and mountain tops
Couldn't stop us sinking in bad decisions
God sent, he came and went
Now we're out here on our own
Your skin, the perfect sin
For a star-crossed lover with double vision
Lips shake, she made a mistake
But she won't leave me alone
You might also like[Bridge]
Loving you was easy 'til you got yourself thinking out loud
Now you got me with my head in the clouds

[Chorus]
You got me with my head in the clouds
With my head in the clouds

[Break]
(With my head in the clouds)
(With my head in the clouds)
You got me with my head in the clouds

[Chorus]
With my head in the clouds
You got me with my head in the clouds2Embed
