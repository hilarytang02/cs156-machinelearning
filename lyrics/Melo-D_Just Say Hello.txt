3 ContributorsJust Say Hello Lyrics[Verse]
It's over now, we lost our way in the dark
I don't know where to go when you're gone
Too late to tell you you're where I belong
Still trembling now, I'm scared to move on

[Pre-Chorus]
The tears I cried, no matter how hard I try
Can't change that all we had is long gone
Your heart can see that this love is enough
And I'd give everything for one more try

[Chorus]
You know I wanna be your destiny, so please just say hello
This love is haunting me and I just need to know
And all the memories are keeping me awake at night
I'm still not over you, there's nothing I can do
You know I wanna be your destiny, so please just say hello
This love is haunting me and I just need to know
And all the memories are keeping me awake at night
I'm still not over you, there's nothing I can do

[Pre-Chorus]
The tears I cried, no matter how hard I try
Can't change that all we had is long gone
Your heart can see that this love is enough
And I'd give everything for one more try
You might also like[Chorus]

This love is haunting me and I just need to know
And all the memories are keeping me awake at night
I'm still not over you, there's nothing I can do
You know I wanna be your destiny, so please just say hello
