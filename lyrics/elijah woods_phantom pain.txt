2 Contributors​​phantom pain Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm biting my tongue, you're biting your nails
Uncomfortable silence, down to a science
I wish I was numb, you make it look easy
Losing your person
Emotional surgeon

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought we'd go it together
Two birds of a feather
Did we fly too close to the sun?

[Chorus]
Now when I turn off the lights, I feel your hands in my hair
All I see in my closet are the clothes you would wear
When I order takeout, I still order for two
When I look in the mirror all that I see is you
'Cause losing your love is like I'm losing a leg
I see that you're gone and all that's left
All that's left is phantom pain

[Verse 2]
Take all my love, a thiеf in the night
Habitually heartless, just mе and the darkness
I wish I was numb like you then maybe this would be easy
'Cause I would give you the air out my lungs
And the worst part is you don't deserve it, no
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I thought we'd go it together
Two birds of a feather
Did we fly too close to the sun?

[Chorus]
Now when I turn off the lights, I feel your hands in my hair
All I see in my closet are the clothes you would wear
When I order takeout, I still order for two
When I look in the mirror all that I see is you
'Cause losing your love is like I'm losing a leg
I see that you're gone and all that's left
All that's left is phantom pain

[Outro]
'Cause losing your love is like I'm losing a leg
I see that you're gone and all that's left
All that's left is phantom painEmbed
[Verse 1]
I'm biting my tongue, you're biting your nails
Uncomfortable silence, down to a science
I wish I was numb, you make it look easy
