13 ContributorsBetter Alone Lyrics[Verse 1]
My heart drops dead every time that I see her run
Upstairs so I can get the picture clearer
Walking past my room in the early afternoon
Long dark hair with an oversize sweater
Know you don't care, but I can pretend that you do
In the early afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, maybe one day suddenly
You'll look up and notice me up there
But I'm too scared

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm better alone (Alone, alone)
I say I'll get better, I won't (Ooh-ooh)
Maybe I'm better alone

[Verse 2]
I woke up in the morning, talked myself up
Got the courage, then I waited in my room
Right before the afternoon
I saw you take the corner
I was opening the door when I saw it, too
It wasn't only you

Maybe I'm better alone (Alone, alone)
I say I'll get better, I won't (Ooh-ooh)
Maybe I'm better alone
Just the way that it's always been
I'll be there for myself
Guess I have to let you go
I'm better off alone
Maybe I'm better alone

[Bridge]
Imagine if it went another way
Imagine if I got the chance to say
That all this time I've waited for you here
Oh, imagine if it went another way
Imagine if I got the chance to say
That all this time I've waited for you

[Chorus]
But maybe I'm better alone (Alone, alone)
I say I'll get better, I won't (Oh, woah, ooh-ooh)
Maybe I'm better alone
Just the way that it's always been
I'll be there for myself
Guess I have to let you go
I'm better off alone
Maybe I'm better alone
