54 ContributorsWhat Am I Lyrics[Verse 1: Corbyn, Corbyn & Daniel]
I met her on a Monday evening
She was standing outside of the park and ride
And I said, "Hey ma, where you been?"
"Been looking for a woman like you for all my life"
And she said, "Hola, talk to me, before I have to leave"
And one day we could be
Maybe more than two lost souls just passing by

[Pre-Chorus: Jonah]
Knew I was falling when I looked inside your eyes
She said, "I know you are, but what am I?"

[Chorus: Daniel & Corbyn]
Tell me, have you seen a sunset
Turn into a sunrise?
Kiss right through the night?
'Cause we should try that sometime
Hold you 'til the mornin'
And if I said I'm fallin', would you just reply
"I know you are, but what am I?"

[Post-Chorus: All, Zach, Corbyn]
(Ah-ooh)
(Ah-ooh) What am I?
(Ah-ooh) What am I?
(Ah-ooh)

Open the door to my apartment, when we get in
Kissin' on my neck and throw my jacket to the side
And I know your heart is beating quick
And if you put your head on my chest, hear the same in mine, yeah
And we'll be making love
Until the sun comes up
But one day maybe I
I could put a ring on your finger before you change your mind, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jonah]
Knew I was falling when I looked inside your eyes
She said, "I know you are, but what am I?"

[Chorus: Daniel & Corbyn]
Tell me, have you seen a sunset
Turn into a sunrise?
Kiss right through the night?
'Cause we should try that sometime
Hold you 'til the mornin'
And if I said I'm fallin', would you just reply
"I know you are, but what am I?"

[Post-Chorus: All, Corbyn, Jonah]
