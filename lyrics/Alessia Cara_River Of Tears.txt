Still got the flowers that you sent
And the note you wrote that said that we were meant to be forever
I keep them all as evidence
In a drawer under the mirror, filled with empty promises

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why I keep letting you lie to me
Hard as I try, it seems I can't breakaway
I thought that you would be the hero, come and save the day
But you're a villain, your sins aren't forgiven

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down, and you have watched me drown
In the river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
(Ho-ahh) Go ahead and wish me well
(Ahh) I'll cry a wishin' well
(Ahh) I'll fly before I fail
(Haa) I'll set sail and drift away
So, I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In the river of tears
In the river of tears

I catch your scent in every wind
And I recall the love we had, I can't pretend
That I don't miss you every now and then
But the hurt is for the better, movin' on, it's now or never

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ho-ahh) Lost in the tide, (Ahh) I can't keep my pillows dry
(Ahh) Like there's a sea in my eyes, (Ahh) I realize that sometimes
Love brings you flowers, then it builds you coffins
And far too often, we end up falling to our demise

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down, and you have watched me drown
In the river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
(Ho-ahh) Go ahead and wish me well
(Ahh) I'll cry a wishin' well
(Ahh) I'll fly before I fail
(Haa) I'll set sail and drift away
So, I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In the river of tears
In the river of tears
[Bridge]
(Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Cry me a river, build myself a bridge, I'm over this
Can't let memories become the death of me, I'm glad to see
(Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Everything that you are and I believe that you are
Everything I needed but I don't need no more

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down, and you have watched me drown
In the river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
(Ho-ahh) Go ahead and wish me well
(Ahh) I'll cry a wishin' well
(Ahh) I'll fly before I fail
(Haa) I'll set sail and drift away
So, I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In the river of tears
