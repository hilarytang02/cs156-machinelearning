I think of you when I think about forever
I hear a joke and I know you would've told it better
I think of you out of the blue when I'm watching a movie that you'd hate
You'd say it, you were never one to hesitate
You were always first in line, so why would it be different for Heaven?
But I got a couple questions

[Chorus]
Is there a bar up there where you've got a favorite chair?
Where you sit with friends and talk about the wеather?
Is there a placе you go to watch the sunset?
And, oh, is there a song you just can't wait to share?
Yeah, I know, you'll tell me when I get there, hmm

[Verse 2]
Do you think of me? Do you wish that I would slow down?
Are there some things that you've seen that feel like home now?
Are you up there climbing trees, singing brand new melodies?
I hope you are, I know you are

[Chorus]
Is there a bar up there where you've got a favorite chair?
Where you sit with friends and talk about the weather?
Is there a place you go to watch the sunset?
And, oh, is there a song you just can't wait to share?
Yeah, I know, you'll tell me when I get there
Yeah, yeah, you'll tell me when I get there
You might also like[Bridge]
Will you save me a place with all those pearls of wisdom?
Yeah, I'll make some mistakes and you'll watch me as I live them
'Til I'm through, 'til I'm with you

[Chorus]
Is there a bar up there where you've got a favorite chair?
Where you sit with friends and talk about, talk about the weather?
Is there a place you go to watch the sunset?
And, oh, is there a song you just can't wait to share?
Yeah, I know (I know), you'll tell me when I get there, yeah
