3 ContributorsUnlearn You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I remember that night, it was 3:45
We were sittin' in a parking lot
Trying to fight all the tears in our eyes
'Cause we knew that we'd mess this up
I'm still holding onto our last conversation
You asked me to drive you home
You're stuck on my mind
'Cause you're all that I've ever known

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I've tried over and over again
But it all reminds me of us

[Chorus]
Wish that I could unlearn you
Forget all about you
Erase all of the memories you left when you walked away
Wish that I could unlearn
All of the best things about you
That would make it easier for me to be okay
I wish I could unlearn you

[Verse 2]
Trying to break you like you're a bad habit
I don't know where I go wrong
I wish I could hate you, I need a distraction
'Cause, baby, you feel like home
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I've tried over and over again
But it all reminds me of us

[Chorus]
Wish that I could unlearn you
Forget all about you
Erase all of the memories you left when you walked away
Wish that I could unlearn
All of the best things about you
That would make it easier for me to be okay

[Bridge]
If only I could close my eyes
Different ending to the storyline
If only I could see a world where there was no you and I
And maybe if I didn't fall
And give you all I had and more
I wouldn't be laying here and trying not to call

[Outro]
I know I won't unlearn you
I'm still thinking 'bout you
Won't erase the memories you left when you walked away
I can't unlearn
All of the best things about you
I know that, eventually, I will be okayEmbed
