5 ContributorsCherry On Top Lyrics[Verse 1]
After the show, at that party that night
In the glow of the sapphire light
I could only see your face and nothing else
I went straight for your hand and I took you away
Just to say what I needed to say
"I get it now, I finally fell"

[Pre-Chorus]
You always knew that it would all work out
I had to catch up to the plans that you made
It doesn't matter 'cause it's clear to me now

[Chorus]
The way that you know me
In the way that you hold me
You give me all the room to grow but never letting go of me
The way that you free me
In the way that you see me
You're my sundae feeling, it's a sweet life even when it's not

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause your love is the cherry on top
Yeah your love is the cherry on top

[Verse 2]
Even before we woke up with our clothes on the floor
Who you are I already adored
I knew your heart, I knew your soul
Now a kiss is just one other thing on the list
Of the moments that brought us to this
Don't know what I was waiting for
You might also like[Chorus]
The way that you know me
In the way that you hold me
You give me all the room to grow but never letting go of me
The way that you free me
In the way that you see me
You're my sundae feeling, it's a sweet life even when it's not

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause your love is the cherry on top
Yeah your love is the cherry on top

[Pre-Chorus]
I shoulda known that it would all work out
It's even better than the plans that you made
Now it's a feeling that I can't live without

[Chorus]
The way that you know me
In the way that you hold me
You give me all the room to grow but never letting go of me
The way that you free me
In the way that you see me
You're my sundae feeling, it's a sweet life even when it's not

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause your love is the cherry on top
Yeah your love is the cherry on top
Your love is the cherry on topEmbed
