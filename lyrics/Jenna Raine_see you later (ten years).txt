It's funny, 'cause I've always dreamed of me and you
Now here we are, staring at the stars
You just broke my heart
Even though you promised you'd never do that from the start
But I guess we can only make it so far

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause time wasn't in our favor
This isn't "goodbye," this is simply "see you later"

[Chorus]
Let me know when it's time to come back
Maybe when your life is on track
And you don't have to hesitate
Hopefully it isn't too late
Luckily for you I'm patient
I'm okay with you making me wait
And as long as you're near, I'll be hеre
Even if it takes tеn years

[Verse 2]
Can't fall in love, when I found the one
How am I supposed to move on
When you're never really too far gone?
The memories won't go away
I feel pain every time I hear your name
But I always think of you the same
