You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh, I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake, Both]
Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy
Can't remember when
I last saw you laughing
This world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
Just, call me up
'Cause I will always be there

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake, Anna Kendrick, Both]
And I see your true colors, shinin' through
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors are beautiful
I see your true colors, shinin' through (True colors)
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow, ohh, ohh, ohh, like a rainbow
