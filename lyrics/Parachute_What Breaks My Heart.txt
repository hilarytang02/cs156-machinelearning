5 ContributorsWhat Breaks My Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's not the way you didn't see me
I never come here anymore
You have a life, you have to live it
And I can't blame you at all
It's not the way I saw you kiss him
Before you got out of the car
But I could tell you really love him
That's what breaks my heart

[Chorus]
I wonder, maybe if I walk these streets again
Maybe I could find it
Looking for a train I didn't miss
Maybe I could ride it out
Till the sun, in the morning
I'll be fine, in the morning
Sleep it off, till the morning comes

[Verse 2]
It's strange to be here in the same room
To breathe the same air that you are
But now I'm stuck here on an island
Where I can't even see the stars
But I still see, just how perfect we can be, yeah
And that's what breaks my heart
You might also like[Chorus]
I wonder, maybe if I walk these streets again
Maybe I could find it
Looking for a train I didn't miss
Maybe I could ride it out
Till the sun, in the morning
I'll be fine, in the morning
Sleep it off, till the morning comes

[Bridge]
Oh, I know you couldn't believe
Yeah I knew it couldn't be me
You were leaving when you noticed
And you were kind, to say hello
But there's a truth I came to terms with
As you walked out of the door

[Outro]
See, there's a chance in never knowing
There's a hope in holding on
To finally know you'll never love me
If I'm honest...
That's what breaks my heart
That's what breaks my heart
That's what breaks my heartEmbed
