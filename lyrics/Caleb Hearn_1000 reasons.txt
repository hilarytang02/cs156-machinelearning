3 Contributors1000 Reasons Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a thousand reasons this won't work
I can count the ways we'll crash and burn
There's a thousand reasons not to try
But is one enough to change your mind?

[Verse 2]
There's a hundred ways to break your heart
But I'll never know if we don't start
There's a hundred signs to let you go
But is one enough to hold me close?

[Chorus]
'Cause life
Is full of wasted moments that felt right
And don't we have enough for us to dive right in?
Even if we don't know how this ends

[Verse 3]
There's a million chances for mistakеs
That we both can't promise not to make
Thеre's a million doubts that you might have
But is a spark enough to not hold back?

[Chorus]
'Cause life
Is full of wasted moments that felt right
And don't we have enough for us to dive right in
Even if we don't know how this ends
You might also like[Instrumental Break]
