14 ContributorsFall In Love Alone Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm familiar with unrequited
I know you got a heart that's undecided just like mine
It takes its sweet time
I been shy to dive into the deep end
'Cause I don't really wanna lose a good friend, but I might
Find something divine

[Pre-Chorus]
It's electric every time we touch
I've been living for this head rush
But sometimes it's too much

[Chorus]
If we never try
How will we know
Baby, how far this thing could go
Give me a sign
If I'm on your mind
I don't want to fall in love alone

[Verse 2]
I wish that I could tell what you were thinking
I hate that I slip up when I've been drinking, but oh wеll
I can't help myself
I'm getting rеally tired of this back and forth
Why don't we just give in to this driving force? I mean
There's something between us
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
It's electric every time we touch
I've been living for this head rush
But sometimes it's too much

[Chorus]
If we never try
How will we know
Baby, how far this thing could go
Give me a sign
If I'm on your mind (You know that you're on my mind)
I don't want to fall in love alone
(I don't want to fall in love alone)
If we never try (I don't want to fall in love alone)
How will we know
Baby, how far this thing could go (Just how far this thing will go)
Give me a sign (Give me a sign, give me a sign)
If I'm on your mind
I don't want to fall in love alone (Alone)
(Ooh)

[Outro]
Fall, I don't wanna fall
I don't wanna fall in love alone (You just need to be right here next to me)
Fall, I don't wanna fall (Next to me, next to me)
I don't wanna fall in love alone (I don't wanna be without you, baby)
Fall, I don't wanna fall (I don't want)
I don't wanna fall in love alone (I, I, I)
Fall, I don't wanna fall (I can't be alone)
I don't wanna fall in love alone (Alone)8Embed
