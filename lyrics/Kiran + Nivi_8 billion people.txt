5 Contributors8 billion people Lyrics[Verse 1: Kiran]
There are eight billion people in the world
But not a single one who understands
I might as well be the only living girl
Wanna be happy but I feel embarrassed to say that I'm lonely

[Pre-Chorus: Kiran & Nivi]
Imagine someone caring for me every day and night
But now I don't have anyone to ask if I'm alright

[Chorus: Kiran, Nivi]
Stop saying I'm pretty
'Cause pretty girls don't spend Friday nights alone in the kitchen
Stop saying I'm funny
'Cause funny girls don't lock themselves in a room to cry
Doesn't matter how many friends I have
'Cause truth is, I'll sit down at 12 a.m. and the only facе I see is me
If only eight billion peoplе could help a bit

[Verse 2: Nivi]
Tryna cope with all the insecurities
Seeing my friends having the best lives don't make me feel better

[Pre-Chorus: Kiran & Nivi]
Imagine someone caring for me every day and night (Every night)
But now I don't have anyone to ask if I'm alright

Stop saying I'm pretty
'Cause pretty girls don't spend Friday nights alone in the kitchen
Stop saying I'm funny
'Cause funny girls don't lock themselves in a room to cry
Doesn't matter how many friends I have
'Cause truth is, I'll sit down at 12 a.m. and the only face I see is me
If only eight billion people could help a bit

[Bridge: Kiran & Nivi]
Crowded parties, busy streets
Hanging with my friends
Fireworks on New Year's Eve
But I still feel so lonely
Long drives in his Benz, watching sunsets
Seeming like it's perfect
Family time on the weekends
But I still feel so lonely
But I still feel so lonely

[Chorus: Kiran]
Stop saying I'm pretty
'Cause pretty girls don't spend Friday nights alone in the kitchen
Stop saying I'm funny
'Cause funny girls don't lock themselves in a room to cry
Doesn't matter how many friends I have
'Cause truth is, I'll sit down at 12 a.m. and the only face I see is me
