2 ContributorsThe Art of Growing Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can count my friends on one hand
Don’t have the energy to pretend
That everything’s all right when it’s not
I guess that’s the art of growing up
I’m not losing sleep over some
Random dude’s opinion
Been looking but I’m all out of fucks
I guess that’s the art of growing up

[Chorus]
I’m starting to feel like a woman (baby that’s the art of growing up)
After all this time I’m still evolving
Yeah

[Verse 2]
The world it used to be black and white
Now there’s a color show in my mind
Heart is soft but skin is tough
I guess that’s the art of growing up

[Chorus]
I’m starting to feel like a woman (baby that’s the art of growing up)
After all this time I’m still evolving (baby that’s the art of growing up)
Yeah I am ever-changing (baby that’s the art of growing up)
Like the seasons rearranging yeah
Baby that’s the art of growing up
