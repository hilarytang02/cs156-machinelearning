Baby, I, I wanna know
What you think when you're alone
Is it me, yeah?
Are you thinking of me, yeah? Oh
We've been friends now for a while
Wanna know that when you smile
Is it me, yeah?
Are you thinking of me, yeah? Oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
Girl, what would you do?
Would you wanna stay
If I were to say?

[Chorus: All, Harry]
I wanna be last, yeah
Baby, let me be your, let me be your last first kiss
I wanna be first, yeah
Wanna be the first to take it all the way like this
And if you only knew
I wanna be last, yeah
Baby, let me be your last
Your last first kiss

[Verse 2: Niall, Louis]
Baby, tell me what to change
I'm afraid you'll run away
If I tell you
What I've wanted to tell you, yeah
Maybe I just gotta wait
Maybe this is a mistake
I'm a fool, yeah
Baby, I'm just a fool, yeah, oh, oh
