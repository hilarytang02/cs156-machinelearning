Heard that it might rain
I wanted to keep my sneakers dry
Thought maybe this time
I could actually keep them white
I wanted to run, but
I was afraid to go outside

[Chorus]
There's a broken energy I find inside
Stuck in a submarine, it seems that I'm
My only enemy sometimes

[Verse 2]
I had an hour
Before the clouds were coming in
It was one of those now (One of those now)
Or never kind of moments
To feel the sunlight (To feel the sunlight)
While everything else goes to shit (Shit)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
There's a broken energy I find inside
Stuck in a submarine, it seems that I'm
My only enemy sometimes
You might also like[Outro]
When the world is ending
Gotta have someone pretending with you
When the world is ending
Gotta keep all of your blessings in view
When the world is ending
Gotta have someone pretending with you
When the world is ending
Gotta keep the mood ascending right through
When the world is ending
Gotta have someone pretending with you
When the world is ending
Gotta keep all of your blessings in view
When the world is ending
Gotta have someone pretending with you
When the world is ending
Gotta keep the mood ascending right through

[Outro]
When the world is ending
Gotta have someone pretending with you
When the world is ending
Gotta keep all of your blessings in view
When the world is endingEmbed
