I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me, I will use them both
We made a start, be it a false one, I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

[Chorus: Harry]
I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holdin' you, oh
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen

[Verse 2: Niall, Liam]
We took a chance, God knows we've tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink, oh, love
And let's split the night wide open
And we'll see everything we can
Living love in slow motion, motion, motion
