Mm-mm-mm

[Verse 1: Sasha Sloan]
Was it that night you didn't ask where I had been?
Was it that fight we didn't have when I came in?
Was it the first time that you saw me drunk?
Second time that I said, "I'm sorry"?
Third time that I didn't call?
Stayed out and missed your party?
That time I met your friends, I was indifferent
The way you're acting's got me questioning

[Chorus: Sasha Sloan]
When was it over for you?
When was it over?
When was the moment you knew
That you were gonna walk out eventually?
It's still not over for me (Mm-mm-mm)
It's still not over for me (Mm-mm-mm)

[Verse 2: Sam Hunt]
When I didn't ask if you were okay
Aftеr a fight with your mom
The last time I stayed ovеr at your place
And you woke up alone
Was it the first time you pulled away?
Second time that we drove to Texas?
Third time we ran into one of my random exes?
So was it ever real or was it all pretend?
The way you're acting's got me wonderin'

When was it over for you?
When was it over? (When was it over?)
When was the moment you knew
That you were gonna walk out eventually?
It's still not over for me (Mm-mm-mm)
It's still not over for me (Mm-mm-mm)

[Bridge: Sam Hunt, Sasha Sloan]
I'm still holdin' on to you
But I know you're already gone
I'm still wakin' up to you
I've been holdin' on for too long

[Chorus: Sasha Sloan & Sam Hunt, Sam Hunt]
When was it over for you?
When was it over? (Oh, when was it over?)
When was the moment you knew
That you were gonna walk out eventually?
Tell me, when was it over for you?
When was it over? (Oh-oh)
When was the moment you knew
That you were gonna walk out eventually?
It's still not over for me

[Outro: Sasha Sloan & Sam Hunt]
I'm still holdin' on to you
But I know you're already gone
It's still not over for me
I'm still wakin' up to you
I've been holdin' on for too long
(When was it over?)
