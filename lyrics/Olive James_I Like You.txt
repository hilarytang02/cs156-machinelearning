I like you, it's as simple as can be
I  like you, every little thing about you
Your  brown eyes, blue car, short hair, long sleeves

[Olivia Rudeen]
I like you, every freckle on your face
I like you, ain't no two ways about it
I  like the way you say my name

[Both]
Good  morning, good night
I'm yours, I'll stay

[Both]
I  like you, the quite way you talk to me
When it's dark and the whole rest of the world is sleeping
We laugh, we sing, warm bed, cold feet

[Both]
What if I said you're the only one?
And  forever could never be long enough
You hum when you think, I say too much
I mean it all, believe me love

[Both]
I like you, it's as simple as can be
I like you, every little thing about you
Your brown eyes, your blue car, short hair, long sleevesYou might also likeEmbed
