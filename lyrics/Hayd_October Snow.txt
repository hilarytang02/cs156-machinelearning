4 ContributorsOctober Snow Lyrics[Verse 1]
I pulled you close, just to let you go
We built our love, just to watch it fall
You gave me joy, now I feel nothing at all
Is my heart made of stone, or are we drifting apart?

[Chorus]
The sting of October snow, of October snow
Is drifting down into my bones, oh my bones
In your heart, I built my home, oh my home
I should've known, yeah I should've known, I'd let you go
I'd let you go

[Verse 2]
I pulled you close, just to let you go
We built our love, just to watch it fall
You gave me joy, now I feel nothing at all
Is my heart made of stone, or are we drifting apart?

[Chorus]
The sting of October snow, of October snow
Is drifting down into my bones, oh my bones
In your heart, I built my home, oh my home
I should've known, yeah I should've known, I'd let you go
I'd let you go

Maybe I'm crazy but baby I looked at you and could not help but sing
My winter heart suddenly blossomed right into spring
Maybe I'm crazy but baby I looked at you and saw a wedding ring
But now I'm all alone and I feel the stingEmbed
[Verse 1]
I pulled you close, just to let you go
We built our love, just to watch it fall
You gave me joy, now I feel nothing at all
Is my heart made of stone, or are we drifting apart?

[Chorus]
The sting of October snow, of October snow
Is drifting down into my bones, oh my bones
In your heart, I built my home, oh my home
I should've known, yeah I should've known, I'd let you go
I'd let you go

[Verse 2]
I pulled you close, just to let you go
We built our love, just to watch it fall
You gave me joy, now I feel nothing at all
Is my heart made of stone, or are we drifting apart?

[Chorus]
The sting of October snow, of October snow
Is drifting down into my bones, oh my bones
In your heart, I built my home, oh my home
I should've known, yeah I should've known, I'd let you go
I'd let you go

[Outro]
Maybe I'm crazy but baby I looked at you and could not help but sing
My winter heart suddenly blossomed right into spring
Maybe I'm crazy but baby I looked at you and saw a wedding ring
But now I'm all alone and I feel the sting
