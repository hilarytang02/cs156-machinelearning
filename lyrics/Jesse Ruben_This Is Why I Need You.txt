8 ContributorsThis Is Why I Need You Lyrics[Verse One]
I have so many questions and places to go
There are too many options, far too many unknowns
This is why I need you

[Verse Two]
And everyone talks now, but no one is right
There are too many armies, with no one to fight
This is why I need you

[Chorus]
'Cause you make the darkness less dark
You make the edges less sharp
You make the winter feel warmer
And you make my weakness less weak
You make the bottom less deep
You make the waiting feel shorter
You make my crazy feel normal, every time
You are the who, love is the what, and this is the why

[Verse Three]
There are so many problems and no one who cares
There are so many roads, and they all need repairs
This is why I need you

[Verse Four]
And there's not enough chocolate, there's too many chores
There are so many mountains that I haven't explored
This is why I need you
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause you make the darkness less dark
You make the edges less sharp
You make the winter feel warmer
And you make my weakness less weak
You make the bottom less deep
You make the waiting feel shorter
You make my crazy feel normal, every time
You are the who, love is the what, and this is the why

[Outro]
You keep the ship moving forward
And you make it easy to try
You make my crazy feel normal, every time
You are the who, love is the what, and this is the why
You are the who, love is the what, and this is the why
You are the who, love is the what, and this is the why2Embed
