8 ContributorsPasta Lyrics[Intro: Alec McGarry]
All she wanted was a bowl of pasta
Without anybody looking at her
So I asked her "baby what's the matter
With that?"

[Verse 1: Nathan Lambert]
Sweat pants, hair up on the sofa
Swear down yeah that's how I know ya
She said I look alright, I
I don't wanna go out tonight
So we can stay in and I can make you something
We ain't gotta dress up for nothing
Feet up with the TV on
And all she wanted...

[Chorus: Alec McGarry]
All she wanted was a bowl of pasta
Without anybody looking at her
So I asked her "baby what's the matter
With that?"
She said "I know it's stupid but it's complicated
There's been a lot of pressure on me lately
To wake up everyday and look amazing"
So I said "you're the prettiest thing in the world"
Look at what we've done to the girl

Why you always scrolling through your phone
Only comfortable when we're on our own
Why you gotta care what people think
Gotta make your own rules, do your own thing
Wish she knew all the good she's got
Instead of tryna be someone she's not
Yeah
'Cause all she wanted

[Chorus: Alec McGarry]
All she wanted was a bowl of pasta
Without anybody looking at her
So I asked her "baby what's the matter
With that?"
She said "I know it's stupid but it's complicated
There's been a lot of pressure on me lately
To wake up everyday and look amazing"
So I said "you're the prettiest thing in the world"
Look at what we've done to the girl

Oh oh
Look at what we've done

[Bridge: All]
And I'll tell you everyday
I love you just the way
You are so don't you change
Don't you change no
So be who you wanna be
'Cause you're everything you need
You're everything to me
Oh
[Chorus: Alec McGarry]
All she wanted was a bowl of pasta
