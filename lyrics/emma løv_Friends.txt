2 ContributorsFriends Lyrics[Verse 1: Jordy]
You're so close, I can taste it
But I'm over how you over complicate it
'Cause it's so good when we're wasted
But it's over when we're sober and I hate it

[Pre-Chorus: Jordy]
Baby 'cause you
Will tell me you're down but then you freak out
It's all new
If it's too much instead of calling it love

[Chorus: Jordy]
We can be friends
Weekends in the back of your car
We don't have to talk about the shit we do in the dark
If you're scared to call it something more
I can be the friend you're looking for
We can make out
Don't count if we're closing our eyes
Don't you know that you and I could have the time of your life?
If you're scared you're gonna want some more
I can be the friend you're looking for

[Verse 2: emma løv]
I don't need romantics, no horse in the carriage
You leave me a rose and be glad that it's bullshit
If I'm being honest, I don't need a promise
You keep tryna talk when we should be makin' out
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Jordy & emma løv]
You
Will tell me you're down but then you freak out
It's all new
If it's too much instead of calling it love

[Chorus: Jordy, emma løv & Both]
We can be friends
Weekends in the back of your car
We don't have to talk about the shit we do in the dark
If you're scared to call it something more
I can be the friend you're looking for
We can make out
Don't count if we're closing our eyes (Closing our eyes)
Don't you know that you and I could have the time of your life? (Time of your life)
If you're scared you're gonna want some more
I can be the friend you're looking for
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

You
You tell me you're down, then turn it around
It's on you, so if you wanna fuck baby don't call it love
[Chorus: Jordy, emma løv & Both]
We can be friends
Weekends in the back of your car
When it ends I'll think about the way you feel in the dark
If you're scared to call it something more
I can be the friend you're looking for
We can make out
Don't count if we're closing our eyes (Closing our eyes)
Don't you know that you and I could have the time of your life? (Time of your life)
If you're scared you're gonna want some more (If you're scared you're gonna want some more)
