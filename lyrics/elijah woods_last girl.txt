6 Contributorslast girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
St Lawrence River, a quarter to five
You ask if I'm swimming and I didn't think twice
My head going under, I come up for air
And you're just sitting there

[Pre-Chorus]
There must be something in the water
'Cause I've never seen it this clear

[Chorus]
It's you and me in the August heat
The bright orange everglow
The southern sky
When it hits your eyes there ain't nowhere I wanna go
This moment is perfect
Sunburnt, shirtlеss
Then everything starts to movе slow
Then suddenly
It just hit me
You're the last girl I'm bringing home

[Verse 2]
The low lit horizon
The song in the silence
A bottle of lightning
The words can't describe it
But all I know
There ain't no way that I'm letting go
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I swear there must be something in the water
'Cause I've never seen it this clear

[Chorus]
It's you and me in the August heat
The bright orange everglow
The southern sky
When it hits your eyes, there ain't nowhere I wanna go
This moment is perfect
Sunburnt, shirtless
Then everything starts to move slow
Then suddenly
It just hit me
You're the last girl I'm bringing home

[Outro]
This moment is perfect
Sunburnt, shirtless
Then everything starts to move slow
Then suddenly
It just hit me
You're the last girl I'm bringing homeEmbed
