I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, Princess
Now, when did you last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no, or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

[JASMINE]
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here, it's crystal-clear
That now, I'm in a whole new world with you

[ALADDIN]
Now I'm in a whole new world with you

[JASMINE]
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
You might also like[JASMINE & ALADDIN]
A whole new world (Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see
(Hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be
A whole new world (Every turn a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue (Every moment red-letter)

[ALADDIN & JASMINE]
I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

[ALADDIN & JASMINE]
A whole new world (A whole new world)
That's where we'll be (That's where we'll be)
A thrilling chase, a wondrous place

[ALADDIN & JASMINE]
