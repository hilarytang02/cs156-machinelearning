7 Contributors24/7, 365 Lyrics[Chorus]
It's been three years
And six whole months since I saw your face that night
It took five seconds to fall in love
And two more to make you mine
Now it's four in the morning
Suns set and seven minutes with you and it's heaven
Ain't an hour that rolls by
I love you 24/7, 365

[Verse 1]
Give you my name, if you wanted to
Key to my heart, if you want it too
And I hope and pray that you'll stay right here
'Til we're old and grey in our last few years
I'm on a knee, I just need a yes
A couple kids and a picket fence
Share the memories like an open book
Every page I read, it still got me hooked

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm fine spending my whole life on everything you like
Is it obvious that all of this is right?

[Chorus]
'Cause it's been three years
And six whole months since I saw your face that night
It took five seconds to fall in love
And two more to make you mine
Now it's four in the morning
Suns set and seven minutes with you and it's heaven
Ain't an hour that rolls by
I love you 24/7, 365
You might also like[Verse 2]
I'll share the last bite of every meal
I'll wipe your tears when you're in your feels
And I'll hold you close through a thunderstorm
When it's cold at night know I'll keep you warm

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm fine spending my whole life on everything you like
Is it obvious that all of this is right?

[Chorus]
'Cause it's been three years
And six whole months since I saw your face that night
It took five seconds to fall in love
And two more to make you mine
Now it's four in the morning
Suns set and seven minutes with you and it's heaven
Ain't an hour that rolls by
I love you 24/7, 365
I love you 24/7, 365

[Outro]
Now it's four in the morning
Suns set and seven minutes with you and it's heaven
Ain't an hour that rolls by
I love you 24/7, 365Embed
[Chorus]
It's been three years
And six whole months since I saw your face that night
It took five seconds to fall in love
And two more to make you mine

Suns set and seven minutes with you and it's heaven
Ain't an hour that rolls by
I love you 24/7, 365
