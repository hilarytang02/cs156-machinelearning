First things first
We start the scene in reverse
All of the lines rehearsed
Disappeared from my mind
When things got loud
One of us running out
I should have turned around
But I had too much pride

[Pre-Chorus 1]
No time for goodbyes
Didn't get to apologize
Pieces of a clock that lies broken

[Chorus]
If I could take us back, if I could just do that
And write in every empty space the words "I love you" in replace
Then maybe time would not erase me
If you could only know I never let you go
And the words I most regret are the ones I never meant to leave
Unsaid Emily

[Verse 2]
Silent days, mysteries and mistakes
Who'd be the first to break?
I guess we're alike that way
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
He said, she said
Conversations in my head
And that's just where they're gonna stay forever

[Chorus]
If I could take us back, if I could just do that
And write in every empty space the words "I love you" in replace
Then maybe time would not erase me
If you could only know I never let you go
And the words I most regret are the ones I never meant to leave
Unsaid Emily

[Bridge]
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

[Chorus]
If I could take us back, if I could just do that
And write in every empty space the words "I love you" in replace
Then maybe time would not erase me
If you could only know I never let you go
And the words I most regret are the ones I never meant to leave
