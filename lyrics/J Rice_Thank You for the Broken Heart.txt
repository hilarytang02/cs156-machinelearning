7 ContributorsThank You For The Broken Heart Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah, oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Everything I know about love
I learned from you, from you
And everything I know about pain
I learned from you, you
You were my only, you were my first
You showed me lonely
And you took me in when I was hurt
But the most important thing you ever gave me
You was the one that hurt the most

[Chorus]
So thank you for the broken heart (Oh, yeah)
And thank you for the permanent scar
'Cause if it wasn't for you
I might forget, how it feels to let go
And how it feels to get a brand new start
So thank you for the broken heart

[Verse 2]
I still remember when you called
And said that he didn't admit anything
And how could you expect me to
Look at you the same way (Look at you the same way)
You were my only but not my last
You showed me lonely
And you made me put you in the past
The most important thing you ever gave me
Was the one that hurt the most
You might also like[Chorus]
So thank you for the broken heart (Oh, yeah)
And thank you for the permanent scar
'Cause if it wasn't for you
I might forget, how it feels to let go
And how it feels to get a brand new start
So thank you for the broken heart

[Bridge]
And everytime I find myself alone in pieces
I find myself
I'll just remember when you hurt me
And I made it

[Chorus]
So thank you for the broken heart
And thank you for the permanent scar
'Cause if it wasn't for you
I wouldn't be here with the love of my life
All my pain disappear, I've come so far
So thank you for the broken heart

[Outro]
I thank you, I thank you for the broken heart
Oh, yeah, oh-oh
For the broken heart
I'll never have a broken a heart again2Embed
