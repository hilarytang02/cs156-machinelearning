25 ContributorsBeautiful in White Lyrics[Verse 1]
Not sure if you know this, but when we first met
I got so nervous, I couldn't speak
In that very moment, I found the one, and
My life had found its missing piece

[Chorus]
So as long as I live I love you
Will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now 'til my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white, tonight

[Verse 2]
What we have is timeless, my love is endless
And with this ring, I say to the world
You're my every reason, you're all that I believe in
With all my heart, I mean every word

[Chorus]
So as long as I live I love you
Will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now 'til my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white, tonight
You look so beautiful in white, yeah, yeah
Na-na-na-na, so beautiful in white, tonight

And if a daughter's, what our future holds
I hope she has your eyes
Finds love like you and I did, yeah
And if she falls in love, we'll let her go
I'll walk her down the isle
She'll look so beautiful in white, yeah, yeah
So beautiful in white

[Chorus]
So as long as I live I love you
Will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now 'til my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white, tonight
Na-na-na-na, so beautiful in white, tonight2Embed
