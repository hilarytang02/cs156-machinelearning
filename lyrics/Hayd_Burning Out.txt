5 ContributorsBurning Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're out of reach
At least that's how it seems
When you're lying next to me
And it's hard to sleep
When you say your mind's at ease
Well, that, I don't believe

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't fool me, darling
No use in stalling
We're doomed and you know it too

[Chorus]
Baby, just look at the stars
Maybe that's all that we are
Feel so close, but we're far away
Further than we think that we are
Gravity pulls us apart
Adding to the weight on my heart
Used to shine bright in the dark
But, in the light, we've lost our spark
We're burning out

[Verse 2]
Therе's parts of me
Still clinging to our dreams
And all that we could bе
But why pretend?
If we know that in the end
It'll cost us everything, oh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You can't fool me, darling
No use in stalling
We're doomed and you know it too

[Chorus]
Baby, just look at the stars
Maybe that's all that we are
Feel so close, but we're far away
Further than we think that we are
Gravity pulls us apart
Adding to the weight on my heart
Used to shine bright in the dark
But, in the light, we've lost our spark

[Post-Chorus]
We're burning out
We're burning out
We're burning out
We're burning out

[Bridge]
You'd rather stay and watch us burn
Than run away and not get hurt
But we're burning out
But we're burning out
You'd rather stay and watch us burn
Than run away and not get hurt
But we're burning out
[Chorus]
Baby, just look at the stars
Maybe that's all that we are
Feel so close, but we're far away
Further than we think that we are
Gravity pulls us apart
Adding to the weight on my heart
Used to shine bright in the dark
But, in the light, we've lost our spark

[Post-Chorus]
We're burning out
We're burning out
We're burning out
We're burning outEmbed
