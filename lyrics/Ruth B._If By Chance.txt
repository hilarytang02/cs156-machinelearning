I can't believe it's been all these years
I can't believe I've cried all these tears
My friends tell me I should've moved on
A long long time ago
But what do they know?
What do they know?

[Chorus]
And I don't mean to be selfish
But my heart breaks every time
That I see you smile
'Cause I know that it's not me
Who brings it out of you anymore
You found somebody new
You put me in the past
I don't even know if our memories will last
But if by chance it doesn't work out with her
You'll always have a chance with me in my world

[Verse 2]
I wonder what happens when you hear our song
Do you brush it away or do you sing along?
Do you talk about the future the way we did?
Is there room for me in it, now?
Is there room for me in it?

And I don't mean to be selfish
But my heart breaks every time
That I see you smile
'Cause I know that it's not me
Who brings it out of you anymore
You found somebody new
You put me in the past
I don't even know if our memories will last
But if by chance it doesn't work out with her
You'll always have a chance with me in my world

[Bridge]
Is it so wrong of me to hope she breaks your heart?
Is it so wrong of me to pray she tears you apart?
And I know that in the darkest part of you
You pray and hope and wish for it too

[Chorus]
'Cause you don't mean to be selfish
But your heart breaks every time
That you see me smile
'Cause you know that it's not you
Who brings it out of me anymore
You found somebody new
You put me in the past
I don't even know if our memories will last
But if by chance it doesn't work out with her
You'll always have a chance with me in my world3Embed
