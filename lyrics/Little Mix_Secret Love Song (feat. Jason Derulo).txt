When you hold me in the street
And you kiss me on the dance floor
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't it be like that?
'Cause I'm yours

[Verse 1: Jade, Jesy]
We keep behind closed doors
Every time I see you, I die a little more
Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls
It'll never be enough
It's obvious you're meant for me
Every piece of you, it just fits perfectly
Every second, every thought, I'm in so deep
But I'll never show it on my face

[Pre-Chorus: Jesy]
But we know this
We got a love that is hopeless

[Chorus: Perrie]
Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that?
'Cause I'm yours

When you're with him, do you call his name
Like you do when you're with me? Does it feel the same?
Would you leave if I was ready to settle down?
Or would you play it safe and stay?

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Girl, you know this
We got a love that is hopeless

[Chorus: Perrie & Jason Derulo, Jason Derulo]
Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor? (I wish)
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that?
'Cause I'm yours

[Bridge: Jason Derulo, Leigh-Anne, Leigh-Anne & Jason Derulo]
And nobody knows I'm in love with someone's baby
I don't wanna hide us away
Tell the world about the love we making
I'm living for that day, someday

[Breakdown: Jason Derulo, Jesy]
Why can't I hold you in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that we could be like that
Why can't we be like that?
'Cause I'm yours, I'm yours
[Chorus: Leigh-Anne, Jason Derulo, Perrie, Perrie & Jason Derulo]
Oh, why can't you hold me in the street? (Hold me in the street)
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor? (You on the dance floor)
I wish that it could be like that (I wish)
Why can't it be like that? (I wish)
'Cause I'm yours ('Cause I'm yours)
Why can't I say that I'm in love? (I'm in love)
I wanna shout it from the rooftops (Shout it from the rooftops)
I wish that it could be like that (I wish)
Why can't we be like that?
'Cause I'm yours
