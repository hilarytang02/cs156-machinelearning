1 Contributor有些話要用英文說 (Bilingual Problems) Lyrics不知道要怎麼說
You taking care of yourself?
她應該會遷就你
Still got your things on my shelf, hmm

好想打幾段字 或 錄幾分鐘
但我指尖不夠衝動
You wanna hear what I’ve got to say?

很討厭 今天 沒理由道歉
Cuz I don’t know if I’m crying
Tears are not drying
夜半三點 沒對象宣洩
Cuz I don’t think that I’m fine
I’m sorry that you’re not mine

Lalalalalalala, hmm...
Lalalalalalala (huh, lalalalalalala)
Lalalalalalala, hmm...
Lalalalalalala

I don’t remember your number
單身過得更加好, Oh
I don’t think I care if I don’t see you anymore, huh
And if you call I might not pick up the phone, ohh
You might also like偏偏把思念換做舊相⼀幅
但你當然不會感動 (感動)
You wanna hear what I’ve got to say?

很討厭 今天 沒理由道歉
Cuz I don’t know if I’m crying
Tears are not drying
夜半三點 沒對象宣洩
Cuz I don’t think that I’m fine
I’m sorry that you’re not mine

想準確一點 沒對白道歉
Cuz I don’t know if I’m crying
Tears are not drying
沒法啟齒 但有話想說
Cuz I don’t think that I’m fine (fine)
I’m sorry that you’re not mine
