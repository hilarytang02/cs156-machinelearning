1 Contributor特登 (On Purpose) Lyrics[Anson Kong 江𤒹生「特登」歌詞]

[副歌]
'Cause I've been waiting for so long
And I've been thinking over, oh on and on
Will you be worried when I'm gone
Oh've been waiting
Where you are is where I belong

[主歌一]
想揀一天陰天
海邊有雨 約你在八點
特登不帶傘或更令你在意
想揀一張飛毯
飛得較遠 故意在拖延
特登等到你亦掛念才相見

[導歌]
不想當禮貌太好 (Baby)
心底都給你表露 (Baby)
統統計算不到 衝擊會到
早心知我未夠好 (Baby)
總差點戀愛深度 (Baby)
你有點怒 難平伏便知道

[副歌]
'Cause I've been waiting for so long
And I've been thinking over, oh on and on
Will you be worried when I'm gone
Oh've been waiting
Where you are is where I belong

想揀一齣鬼片
可推介你 播放在枕邊
特登給察覺是我沒有在線
想揀一束乾花
單手致歉 要你亦失眠
或者需倒吊著看才明心意

[導歌]
多一點秘密更好 (Baby)
精心的給你打造 (Baby)
假使理據顛倒 不必懊惱
不須等節日倒數 (Baby)
都可數心跳速度 (Baby)
掃去煙霧 能原諒便知道

[副歌]
'Cause I've been waiting for so long
And I've been thinking over, oh on and on
(Baby thinking over)
Will you be worried when I'm gone
(Baby you know when I'm gone)
Oh've been waiting
Where you are is where I belong
[副歌]
'Cause I've been waiting for so long
And I've been thinking over, oh on and on
Will you be worried when I'm gone
Oh've been waiting
Where you are is where I belongEmbed
