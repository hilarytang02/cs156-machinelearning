1 ContributorSomething LyricsI just need a little bit, warm up your love
I just need a little bit, warm up your love

I swear there's something about you
The way you sneaked in from the blue
我想你應該很清楚
這心跳的感覺 it's true
Love at first sight
I'm caught on you, I
我想你的時候
會不自覺 傻傻的笑
如何不讓旁人擦覺
將會是一輩子的難題
一張紙一張筆
這首歌關於你

Yeah-yeah-yeah, 'cause I know something 'bout you ('bout you)
That separates you from the girls that I once knew
I swear the little things you do (you do, you do)
Makes me just wanna spend all my time with you (oh, uh, shit, is that too much?)

I swear there's something 'bout you (oh, yeah-yeah-yeah)
You say our star sign is the reason that we groovе
And yeah, I think that it be true (yеah, oh, god, I think it's true)
You made a 180 U-turn from high school
That's why I'm falling for you
That's why I'm falling for you, ooh, ooh-ooh
You might also likeI swear there's something about you (about you)
我愛上你那鎖骨上拼錯字的 tattoo
I swear there's something about you
我愛上你那奇怪的脾氣永遠不服輸
我愛上你的一切
不想跟你道別
你是特別的存在
用這首歌記錄下來
Ooh-woah, wanna spend all my time with you

Yeah-yeah-yeah, 'cause I know something 'bout you ('bout you)
That separates you from the girls that I once knew
I swear the little things you do (you do)
Makes me just wanna spend all my time with you (Tyson, you say this to everybody?; Wait-what, n-n-no!)

I swear there's something 'bout you (oh, yeah-yeah-yeah)
You say our star sign is the reason that we groove
And yeah, I think that it be true (I know it's true)
You made a 180 U-turn from high school
That's why I'm falling for youEmbed
I just need a little bit, warm up your love
I just need a little bit, warm up your love

I swear there's something about you
