1 Contributor跟你分擔失落比較快樂 Take It Out On Me (English Translation) LyricsYou don’t need to pretend to be in a good mood or fake happiness
If something truly feels wrong
If you don’t want to explain, there’s no need to respond
This embrace is always here for you

Every time you sigh, you act like nothing’s wrong
Quietly avoiding eye contact again and again
I see you, yet you never speak a word
Trying to cover up your tears and move on as if nothing happened

I don’t know how to handle the sadness you’ve hidden away
Take it out on me—whatever you need to do, it’s okay
Complain, vent, give me orders—it’s all part of bеing your boyfriend

Don’t feel ashamed for being upsеt with me—I’ll be alright
Giving in is second nature; I willingly let you control me however you like
When you’re at your lowest, I worry I can’t comfort you enough
But I want to share your pain. Call me anytime—don’t hesitate

You don’t need to pretend to be in a good mood or fake happiness
If something truly feels wrong
If you don’t want to explain, there’s no need to respond
This embrace is always here for you

Every detail, every story—I’ll sit with you and listen
Even if the conversation becomes too emotional or too heavy with negativity
We can talk all night, even if you worry I can’t handle it
But my greatest happiness is being needed by you
You might also likeAll our little chats, even if they’re unnecessary
My greatest wish is to be interrupted by you

You don’t need to pretend to be in a good mood (Give it to me) or fake happiness (Sit down)
If something truly feels wrong (I’ll be here for you)
If you don’t want to explain, there’s no need to respond (Even if all you let out are)
Crying sounds—this embrace is here for you

Take your anger out on me (Don’t hold back—be as ruthless as you need to)
If you’re upset with someone else (Let’s face it together)
Even if others look down on you (Ignore them), you still have my unconditional love

No matter how despicable others may be (My dear, if you want to be angry, take it out on me)
No matter how cruelly others abandon you (Let my shoulder be your safe haven)
Always remember (You can rely on these arms of mine)—I’m here for you

You don’t need to fake happiness to hide your feelings
You don’t have to change a thing
I want to soothe your unease, but if you don’t want to explain
This embrace will always be here for youEmbed
